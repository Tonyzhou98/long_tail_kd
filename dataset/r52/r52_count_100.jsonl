{"label": "earn", "text": "WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC>. Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday, traders and analysts said. The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987, ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago. That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company earned 70 cts a share. Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2. At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 \"are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low.\" Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year. Crossen said \"because Marion is still just a small company, the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line.\" He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share. \"The company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most innovative company in the business,\" he said. For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY. Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: \"We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\" He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets."}

Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment. Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, Nomura said.

{"label": "ipi", "text": "REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC. The Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said. The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as computers and microprocessors."}

The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is 24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.

Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986 was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an increase in bad debt reserves. Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986. Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which were not adequate at the time of acquisition. He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second and fourth quarters.

At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States.

Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores."}

Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off."}

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment.

U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market.\" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. \"The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,\" he told Reuters. Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY. Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\" Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\" \"The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy,\" said First Chicago's Johnson. \"Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.\""}

Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism.

And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure.

The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep.

Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan. The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan. The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter. The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE. French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America's oldest ally in war and peace.\" \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington. The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers' OPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration's desire to lessen government intervention in trade."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE. The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices,\" a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the \"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers.\" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said."}

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said.

Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month.

The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said. The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats.

Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week. \"We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,\" Levitt said. Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said. However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.

The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive."}

Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said. Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs."}

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.\""}

Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS. One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business."}

The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.

Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news. Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit. \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,\" said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee. \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\" The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program. The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded.

The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS. Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said \"It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. \"The demand wasn't so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said."}

Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended its oil supply contracts, Cote said: \"It's not a question of cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.\" On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system, regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a trial basis to the end of 1987. Under the new system, producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts. Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners. \"We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has been finalized,\" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said. Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast demand for its refineries, Strong said. \"We have to know what they have and how that relates to what we need in total,\" he said. Strong said figures on the amount of crude production Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately available."}

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade). He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies. Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct. Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits. Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange. Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern state of  arequipa. Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies.

In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks, Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain to the public. The company will register a proposed offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters. \"Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,\" Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company would use much of the income from the amusement park chain, were it to be sold, to repay debt. Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at 350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said. Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six Flags by several prospective buyers. The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln dlrs mountain of debt. Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget Inc &lt;GNG.N>.

By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they're on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said."}

The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February. The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline. The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a decline last June of 75,000, the department said. Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct level in March, 1986. Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in recent months, with the gains concentrated in service industries. The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March, while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in March. Business and health services showed the largest gains in jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000. The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0 hours in February, the department said. Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6. The department's survey of households showed the number of unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln. The number of persons working part time for economic reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February. The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19 mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal adjustment, the department said. Mining employment was little changed in March and has not experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986. Other service industries that increased jobs last month were finance, insurance, and real estate."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW. Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.\" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. \"It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, \"We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\" They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets, government officials said."}

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS. Canada may begin monitoring steel flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is being illegally \"trans-shipped\" to the U.S., senior government trade officials said. The officials, asking not to be identified, said the government will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about the level of Canadian exports south of the border. But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified, said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S. \"In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,\" said one official who claimed Canadian companies were \"fair traders\" in the big American market. If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or four months. \"I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would have to do something about it,\" said a trade official. Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago. The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel producers. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the American market be limited to 2.4 per cent. The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country. Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw steel, which makes up less than half the steel market. Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in 1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the same year."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE. Time Inc's chief financial officer, Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is \"comfortable\" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share. In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share, including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced.  On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time. In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest acquisition ever. N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said the company might be interested in a relatively small book business. He said following the recent agreement for the sale of Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, \"there may be pieces that Murdoch doesn't want,\" referring to News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch. Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro said it is a \"delicate subject\", and \"we're looking at all the options.\" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as much as 500 mln dlrs.  Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a special gain in the HBO unit. Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber growth of 800,000 for last year. He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points. Munro said the company does not plan to increase its dividend. Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at getting involved in the home shopping video area. \"It would be foolish not to be a player there,\" he said. He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year, but nothing came of the talks."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. SENATE TRADE LEADER CONCERNED ABOUT CANADA. The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week. The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners. \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement. \"I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,\" he added. Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval. \"I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,\" Bentsen said. Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in Ottawa. Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS. U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here. \"If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc \"If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,\" he added. Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20. The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the API said. Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings. \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France. Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said. Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,\" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED. The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. \"I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. \"I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday's employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE. Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said."}

Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z>, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

{"label": "trade", "text": "EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS. The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said. Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session: \"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.\" Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: \"We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.\" A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work. Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon. Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: \"We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions.\" Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: \"This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.\" West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement. The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January. The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC."}

Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said. \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said. Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don't.\" \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry. \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think,\" Holden-Brown said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\" \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters. Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word.

Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said. However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market."}

It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.

But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports."}

Bally Manufacturing Corp said it expects a charge to earnings in the first quarter of this year of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chicago-based hotel, casino, gambling and amusement concern also said the anticipated charge against first quarter earnings will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes. Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy 2.6 mln of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4 mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of Bally. The agreement also calls for Bally to pay Trump another 6.2 mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said. Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to seek control of the company for 10 years, it said. Bear, Stearns and Co Inc signed a similar standstill agreement with Bally for three years, Bally said. But it can still deal in Bally stock as a broker, it said.

Japan's overall wholesale price index (base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to 86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bank of Japan said. Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December. The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said. The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices, it said. On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January. The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8 pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up 16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said. The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier. The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to 57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier. The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February, its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added to the decline. The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier. The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system. Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected, the bank said."}

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by \"a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.\" U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\" He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\" \"We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA. World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87."}

{"label": "ipi", "text": "SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS. The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January, but major industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of production targets, official figures show. Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year. However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987. The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country's main export to Western nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from 97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983. Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6 billion in 1985. Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures. Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality controls imposed on enterprises. Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of the year compared with the same period of 1986. The figures showed that five republics produced less than in the first two months of 1986."}

The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said.

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson told financial analysts. \"Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new product each year,\" Henderson said. He also said research and development spending in this business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.

Sales in the United States totaled about three billion dlrs, ICI executives said. In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will come from ICI's research and development activities, but the company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition program.

Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year's revenues. This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides. He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future. Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY. Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. \"It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,\" he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. \"They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it,\" Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,\" Hine said. \"It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,\" he added."}

Employers in Rotterdam port's strike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers' organisation spokesman said. An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal fault in the employers' redundancy procedure. The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling. Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was resolved. Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's 4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this year. The employers said there were no immediate plans for meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or on a new work practice agreement in the sector. Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the port's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated, although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector, the employers' spokesman added."}

A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.

Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986. President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress. \"I think it's about time,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, \"It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing.\" Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts. Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products. Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987. \"It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we're serious,\" Smart said of the White House trade sanctions. The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers. \"All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be,\" he said. Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said."}

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.

Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.\" \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\" Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business."}

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.

Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers."}

The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.

The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\" Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks."}

Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today. He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action. Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses. Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs. The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries. \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt,\" he said."}

The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers."}

The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters. \"The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive,\" Monsod said an interview. \"No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.\" The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. \"If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,\" she said. \"But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.\" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. \"I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.\" Monsod said, \"The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.\" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING. Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\" Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said."}

K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985, it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, \"a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations.\" K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.

Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first quarter report.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT. The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. \"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,\" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day."}

Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said. He added: \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000.\" The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last Sepember. The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in June. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

Philippine government revenue is expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from 79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said. In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details. He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. \"In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct,\" he said. Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February. He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform. Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors. The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION. Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30."}

He told reporters:\"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio.\" He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of \"a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs.\" \"At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year,\" he said, \"though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. \"Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better,\" he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. \"But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,\" he said."}

The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\" Hair called the department's proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's annual report says. One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be restored to current earnings status, it said. As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change \"in its entirety\" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules, and although the impact will not be material in the short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report said. The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said. Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in 1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it said. Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place, the report said. This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.

MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at 725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own. \"I think the offer is too low by at least five points,\" said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of \"one of the finest casinos in the world.\" Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares. Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8. A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may issue a public statement after it has studied the offer. Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two dlrs per share.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES. Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,\" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino. \"I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.\" \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA's bid to control production. \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production. He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry. \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said. \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling. \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar,\" he said. Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984. \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said. \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\" He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound. \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,\" he said. Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production. He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup. \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.\" Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986. Yulo said despite next year's increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down. \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season.\""}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>. Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer, either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin) Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want to remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle, Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no steps toward a transaction. \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate battles I've seen,\" said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited from that company's restructuring. \"Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per share,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is seeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction. Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however, believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8. \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's current holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business, which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman. Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office equipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\" Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo security guards. It also has an information services business, and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986, earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs. GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union Carbide shares."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT. Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week. Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE. A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today. \"Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,\" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention. Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level. Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so. Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date. The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.

The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN. Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said. The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane. Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said. The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December. He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane. But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said. \"It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls,\" he said."}

Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues. Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm. Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone's visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5. Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, \"I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended.\" Nakasone did not elaborate. The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact. Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said."}

Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month. The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results. A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries. Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May. One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said. \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography,\" the source said. He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world. \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.

{"label": "acq", "text": "SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES. The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL. U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "JAPANESE GROUPS URGE DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE. Japan's leading economic organisations urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned tax reforms, officials involved said. Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy. Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy. Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy. The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates. Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct. Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990. The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET. Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\" A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\" Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the \"may-buy\" level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.

The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today. Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted. The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were. \"They are going to cut their estimate,\" said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. \"The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate.\" Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted. \"They'll temper it,\" said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. \"The main drop will probably come in July.\" She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES. Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to &lt;American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.

The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said.

{"label": "earn", "text": "DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN. Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses, the company said. \"The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years,\" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. \"But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,\" chairman Macdonald said. \"It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment, and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence,\" he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30, under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs, which are used in the new accounting calculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day from 591.0 mcf a day."}

The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: \"Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.\""}

However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks.

Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said.

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry."}

The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base. Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close."}

The value of China's industrial output in January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said. Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January 1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986. The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. \"No significant improvement was made in economic results,\" it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986. The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986. It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country. It gave no more details. The official industrial growth target this year is seven pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS. Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query. The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said."}

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES. European Community (EC) industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion, but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes, provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products, typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system, which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer proportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw, insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account. The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL. Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company. However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover. \"There are too many uncertainties,\" said one arbitrager. Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4. Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share. The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company. \"Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites. Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co, its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring. Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft, which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50 years ago, has about 12 pct. Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft. \"I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager, but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s. Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout. \"Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved,\" he said, adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft. He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry."}

In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range. In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985. In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26 dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs. Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits. By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow. In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes. Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which expenditures were held below budget."}

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit strangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks."}

It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale, which introduced a new menu. Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill - hurt results. It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items, rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads and baking products major contributors to improvement in the quarter. A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said. Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early retirement program initiated a year ago.

{"label": "alum", "text": "NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE. The London Metal Exchange's, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract. This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS. OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT. Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement. \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said. Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers. \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future. \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS. Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash."}

He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade. He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT. Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services. De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand. Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible.

{"label": "tea", "text": "PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS. Pakistan's decision to suspend tea import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi broking houses and exporters said. Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports. The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports. The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the trade imbalance for some time. \"We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ... (it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market,\" a source at one broking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday. \"The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,\" he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan, Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major markets for its tea, the sources added. Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer to find new outlets, they said."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT. A new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today. The new accord is due to replace the current one, which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented \"a historic moment.\" The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we often faced problems.\" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended, but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto added. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.\" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers, said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.\" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers, agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement \"attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry.\""}

The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers and directors \"concerning participation in a group to acquire control\" of the company. The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft stockholders and members of Taft management about participating in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify any of the other people with whom it had talks. Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion dlr offer for the company. At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser, Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and to supply financial data to other interested bidders. \"If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them backing him on any deal,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. \"I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,\" said Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.

Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2 pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment. Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values for the company.

He said this revision, which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions, takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade.

Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms.

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22. The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires. Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said. The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks. However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity. The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred. Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.

The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result \"of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.\" The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\" \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said. \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,\" the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled \"because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December. Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea Containers' business.

He cited the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers, costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs. He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs."}

Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said. They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed. Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25. The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform. Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable. The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said. Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said. Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said. They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS. The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight rates. The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion pesetas. A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing money supply figures for February. The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth was 11.4 pct last year. The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds. \"The policy is proving counter-productive and rates will have to come down in the long-term,\" the bank spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries. He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad. \"At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other countries with much lower rates,\" he said."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER. Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit, Wall Street analysts said. \"I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works,\" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with L.F. Rothschild. \"There are unquestionably other buyers out there,\" added Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. \"A lot of companies have looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.\" Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif., and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts said. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>, Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust problems, the analysts added. Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino, Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by Fairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs, because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned companies. \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U.S. government didn't want it,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government's apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems. \"The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. \"That, I think, is the real significance of this.\" Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said. However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM. Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production. \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalance and tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, \"differentiated policy treatment is required\" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said. \"Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,\" he said."}

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said \"significant progress\" was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging. Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons, Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries. Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, \"a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.\" In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost. \"Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades, we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising, one that is under-developed and under-employed,\" said Mulroney. \"What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity.\" Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners. Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes, something that would give Canada protection from Washington's tough trade remedy laws. But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a \"fair trader\" and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market. He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides. \"We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is fair to both sides,\" Mulroney said."}

The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.

{"label": "acq", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS. More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore. \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity. \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\" A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves."}

But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\" Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC. Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY. The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\" The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit."}

Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March.

A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\" Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring.\" He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce \"reasonable stability\" in exchange markets over the next few months. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to give time for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was affected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market. Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, \"I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and Japan's) efforts can be carried out. Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar. Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade deficit. Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable."}
{"label": "money-supply", "text": "N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH. Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said. The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement. The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said. Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year. \"Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market,\" Russell said."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD. Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>. General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.\" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM,\" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important.\""}

Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend. The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms. Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines on grants. He added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry. Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post Office. The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany, especially as far as deciding who is able to provide telecommunications equipment."}

{"label": "gold", "text": "\"BRITANNIA\" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM. The new British one ounce gold coin, the \"Britannia,\" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a \"competitive premium,\" Treasury officials said. Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins. Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold. Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases. No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price. There were some enquiries on the \"Britannia\" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said. Some said that the \"Britannia\" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established."}
{"label": "acq", "text": "MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS. Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say. Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a rebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers. \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\" says Cole. \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars,\" he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, \"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares. \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says. \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public,\" said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international. \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says. \"It's not totally off the wall,\" says Cole."}

The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT. In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods. The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules. The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>, whose \"aramid\" synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violate the American company's patents. Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions. The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court. \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States,\" it said in a statement."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS. China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988.

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.. China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.\" The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said. \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,\" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM. The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE. The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that's Baker's strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure."}

The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods. The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said. \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said. The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year. But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products. It extends until January 1993, the administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods."}
{"label": "sugar", "text": "RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING. The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added."}

The Ferruzzi Group's holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION. Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. \"Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY. Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said."}

Chemicals group Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985."}

In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries. \"I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,\" Howard told reporters. \"He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home,\" he added. British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said. Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan. \"I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations,\" Howard said. \"We simply aren't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time.\" Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister. But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade. Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied. Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue. \"There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,\" he added, but gave no details. He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with. \"But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time,\" he added. \"What I've made plain is we expect to see action.\" Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR. The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters. They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised. \"The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock,\" a senior official said. He said the government has finalised an agreement with E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department. Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks. The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said. Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. The Department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes. An Importers Association official said that \"even if the Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more.\" This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said. The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting April 1. Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For the past two years."}

The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION. Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\" He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN. The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "YEUTTER SEES U.S., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT. The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. \"Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.\" He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. \"That's a very healthy development,\" he added.\"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.\" \"Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,\" Yeutter said. \"They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.\" He added, \"Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.\""}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS. A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products. Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL. Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,\" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.\" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. \"It is purely coincidence,\" he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. \"Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family,\" said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET. The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\" \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\" According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out."}

A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of Transportation, and later today it will file a response to USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.

However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened. Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending."}

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.

{"label": "cotton", "text": "ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES. U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said."}

However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product. Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear. \"As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity,\" Sims said in a telephone interview.

King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.\" Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,\" he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said."}

Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. \"We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems\" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said \"Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals.\" Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. \"Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel,\" Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD. The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending. Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax."}

Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.

American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage."}

Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said. \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said. \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility.\""}

Madagascar's available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said. This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside, they said. The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985. Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said. They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes were planted before 1930. The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's 1986-1990 five-year plan. In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said. The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content. The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year."}

Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show.

According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.

{"label": "acq", "text": "NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND. Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said."}

Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining.

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive. \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\" Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable touch of the budget.\" Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said. Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday's 375p. REUTER..."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES. The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said. The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct. An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly. New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc &lt;PBI> said \"the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.\" Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter. Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct. The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant. The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies."}

However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection. \"To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,\" he said.

Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, Annesley said \"Encor is a strategic investment for Dome, and we have no intention of selling it.\" Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares. He also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares. \"Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of Dome Mines stock) are very attractive,\" Annesley commented. \"We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,\" he added.

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said. The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October. Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986. It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports. Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added. Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports. It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985. \"In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances on current account will be bridged over the near term,\" Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report. The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year. The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE. State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus Industrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt and Whitney unit."}

He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits. Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes. \"The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take,\" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency. On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure. Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries. The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations' \"investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there.\" Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said \"I think you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year.\""}

For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs. Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security Administration. The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government officials and defaud the Social Security Administration. Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement. The charges would then be dropped if the defendants successfully complete the probation period. Details of the requirements in the agreement were not immediately available."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR. Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\" He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms."}

Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. \"An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community,\" Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, \"otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.\" Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. \"Something must give soon.

Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. \"It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share,\" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. \"I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts,\" Beall said, adding, \"long-term, we have a very serious problem.\" In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S."}

Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices. Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports. Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said. The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985. Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year. However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices. Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices. He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions."}

The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.

UAL stock today was up three at 63 in active trading. \"They (ferris and Trump) talked last week. Apparently, Trump said he was interested in it as an investment. He didn't say how much stock he had.

The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement. In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement. The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required. \"America's interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments,\" the trade group said. The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday. The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers."}

{"label": "retail", "text": "U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS. U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\""}

{"label": "retail", "text": "FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN. U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\" said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber. Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. \"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales,\" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan. Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period. Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest. Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago. \"February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half.

Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency. But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. \"We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed,\" he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits.

A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress. At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations. The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy. Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds. Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.\" \"I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill,\" he added. Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition.

One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term. Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday. Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue. One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar. The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture. Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992. Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said.

Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said. Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network. \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is also chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>.

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER. Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley. \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's,\" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western."}

Preliminary talks are on between two state-owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC) which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said. G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect. \"It is the other way round,\" Valentchits said. He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, had approached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year. \"We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project,\" Valentchits said. He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were \"only just initial.\" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment. Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation. The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure. Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the lead agent. The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed by Citicorp. It said the government's privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm. The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors. The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos. NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties. The firm produced 1,863 tonnes of nickel in the first two months of 1986, compared with 2,364 tonnes in the same period in 1985. The mine's capacity is 2,000 tonnes a month."}

{"label": "alum", "text": "KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES. Owners of two aluminum smelters in Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky. But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd &lt;AL>, said further viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the rate case is eventually settled. \"We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for sure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter,\" a National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other variables to consider in any decision whether to close or continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles west of Louisville. National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc &lt;NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which holds the rest, the spokesman said. A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, \"The decision is 48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a long time before we can make a decision\" about what it means for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of Louisville. \"But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was denied the requested rate increase.\" A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates. The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which include Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility spokesman said. The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said. \"We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable,\" he said. No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for July 28."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION. Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION. Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said. Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT. The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said. SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points, with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse. The government's banking adviser for the operation was &lt;Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere>, BPGF, owned by French financier Pierre Moussa's &lt;Pallas> group, assisted by Britain's &lt;Hambros Bank Ltd>."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES. Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL. The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners. The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.\" Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.\" Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.\" Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms. \"Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,\" he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan. There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS. German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added."}

He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\" He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.

The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not a factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS. Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve."}

Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.

{"label": "alum", "text": "ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT. Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil. Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX. The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "EXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER. &lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs. Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion. It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day. The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING. A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday. Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level."}

Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured. Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked. \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said. \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said. \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,\" he added. The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states. Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons. Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation."}

Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux &lt;LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference. Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added. Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said. In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee &lt;CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said. Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said. He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years. Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France. Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said. Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market. Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year. Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln."}

Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's \"B\" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987. China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. \"China is short of foreign exchange,\" the Shanghai official said. \"We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer.\" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,\" the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,\" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,\" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA. Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. \"All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN. Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time. She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way. \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said. However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987. Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase. \"We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger,\" Love said, referring to Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical. The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points, Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas' struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6 mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln dlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. \"I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,\" he said. \"The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans.\" In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct. More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans, which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln dlrs the year before, were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four years, he said. \"I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel,\" he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business, Love said. \"We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,\" he said. In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area, and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks, he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>, both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. \"We think we can try to get a little part of their roost,\" he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products, he said. \"We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,\" he said, referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking."}

Galactic Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs. As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984. Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said. Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results. The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said. Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments. Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings. The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces. Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000 ounces."}

Callebaut told Reuters that Amylum, a leading starch and isoglucose manufacturer in which Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc &lt;TATL.L> holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosed initial takeover offer for CPC's European corn wet milling business by the close of CPC's tender on March 17. The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi's 630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said. On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr deal. Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of shares in its unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> to fund the CPC takeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid. \"For the time being we just await developments.

Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems. Producers and consumers indicated support \"in principle\" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said. Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said. Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said. Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said. Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added."}

Tandem Computers Inc said it expects higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter ending March 31 against a year ago. \"We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the quarter,\" James Treybig, president and and chief executive officer, told a meeting of securities analysts. In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned 9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln dlrs. Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is traditionally slower than the first. L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per share.

{"label": "crude", "text": "BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES. British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs."}

Profit from its second largest geographical area, North America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar. Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year. Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a 16.5 mln debit previously.

Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said. Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging. The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said. Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets."}

{"label": "reserves", "text": "MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS. Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring."}

The dollar's tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22. Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's tumble, securities house dealers said. They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said. The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said. They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said. A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market. The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said. Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986, Finance Ministry sources said. The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers said. Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said. \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian dollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at &lt;Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd> said."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT. CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs. The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore production in Australia, they said. Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the Cooper-Eromanga area. \"These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass Strait production now under way,\" McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date, will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss, he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS. Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a \"dominant\" holding, an Italian government committee ruled. The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings, headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision reflected the \"need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.\" It did not quantify what might constitute a \"dominant\" holding. The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly. Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest. The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits. These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank."}

Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.

The main measure of U.K. Broad money, sterling M3, grew a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2-1/4 pct in February after a rise of 1.1 pct in January, the Bank of England said. The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19 pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in January. Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion. Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4 billion rise in January, the Bank said. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in January. Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said. Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by 300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January. On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2 pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January. The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March 30. The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg. Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg, the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was therefore about flat, the Bank said.

World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp &lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability. \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added."}

Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying. \"The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know which way to go,\" one analyst said. Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS. Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. \"There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared."}
{"label": "gnp", "text": "FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH. French gross domestic product will grow by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said. However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct. IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand, unleashing higher import demand. Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298 mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of French debts. Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs. French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct in 1988, it added. Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986. Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986, is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct. However, the institute said inflation would fall back to 2.5 pct at the end of 1988, \"provided that real wage costs remain within the framework of productivity rises.\""}

Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire. A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities."}

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said."}

Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said \"We are gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying the export charge on lumber.\" He added the agreement was important to the health of the U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully carried out."}

{"label": "jobs", "text": "JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT. Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used,\" one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE. Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added. Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said. Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later. Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August."}

{"label": "bop", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP. China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China,\" he said. \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\" Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. \"We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing."}

Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies. But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG &lt;SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES. House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill."}

Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. \"There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking,\" a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. \"The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.\" \"If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month,\" Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year.

Bolivia's top union leader today joined a hunger strike by 1,300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said. Juan Lechin Oquendo, the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization, COB, told reporters: \"I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike\". Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro. The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay. About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia's minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said. \"I will take part in the miners' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast,\" Lechin told reporters. The COMIBOL miners' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry. About 20,000 miners, or two-thirds of the working force, have been laid off through the government's decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price. The government, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has called the miners' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who began a four-day visit last Friday. \"I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike,\" Lechin told reporters. \"I also have to orga- nise the strike.\" Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez, the miners' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast, union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner."}

WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending. The statement said WestLB International's business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year. This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based. Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of 1.1 billion. WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of services for private clients."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY. West Germany's money supply growth slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply, short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January. In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January. Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct. In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash and sight deposits, rose seven pct. International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said. Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise. But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said. Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February. A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities. At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level. The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said. Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank. Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January. A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month."}

U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said. \"People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. \"We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates,\" Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for \"less than ebullient market action,\" Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range. \"My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified,\" Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. \"All of the movement occurs at the opening,\" afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were \"not real exciting,\" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. \"There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment,\" Leiner said. Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979. \"The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal,\" Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said."}

Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS. The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law. The industry trade association called on U.S. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees. The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers. But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate. The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages. The report said securities firms \"should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\" It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information. It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market. It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing. In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval. It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit. The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases. The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics. The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days. The current requirement is expressed in business days. It said so-called \"lockup\" devices, in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company's total common stock. Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY. As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added."}

He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct. He said he was happy with \"a good result\" for February but stressed a need for continued \"vigilance\" against inflation.

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said."}

Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weight of the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand. \"There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas,\" Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.

Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal. But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago. \"It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks),\" Mulroney said. Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, \"Things are running pretty quickly now.\" The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world's largest trading partnership. But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula. \"It's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now, along with the questions of the substance of the agreement,\" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has been highly critical of the talks in the past. But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a \"hard and fast formula.\" Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture. Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.

The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

A company spokesman said the company will take \"some writeoff\" in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further \"carryover\" writeoff in the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year. The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand. It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman. Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800. The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates."}

Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised. Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement. \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added. \"Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said. Standard and Poor's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt. The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>. Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work,\" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA."}

Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed. Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in electronics, trading, food and service industries. Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad. Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln. He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are part of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.

{"label": "earn", "text": "GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS. West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year."}

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY. European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said."}

Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes. There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended. Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the same month last year, figures received by the ISO show. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar. Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was 237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before. Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show."}

Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9 sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for Bertone's steel-structured sports cars. Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association. Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants. Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection. The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said."}

Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. \"Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today,\" one trader said. Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. \"There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak,\" analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said. Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement. The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman said. Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing. Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on. \"Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products,\" he said. \"I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera,\" referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\""}

Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: \"It all depends on France.\" At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technology and assuring \"a mutual advantage.\" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in joint ventures.

He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.

In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date.

Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>. Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. \"They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth,\" said one arbitrager, who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. \"It makes sense,\" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But \"It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a 100 pct of the synergies.\" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. \"This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,\" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer, but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary, speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr \"bridge\" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD. Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account."}

Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.

The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.

A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE. Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE. The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said. The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.\" The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices. \"I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,\" he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine Fleming's Edwards said. \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,\" Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\""}

South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said \"yes, I think so.\" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.

He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said \"I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.\" But he added \"the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons.\" Speaking of his own country, he said \"We have made a lot of concessions already.\" He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said \"at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.\" South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton. The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY. There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said. Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move. The sources today said the government's policy remained one of \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct. The sources said that with France's economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies."}

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it has had discussions with other Taft stockholders and some company managers and directors \"concerning participation in a group to acquire control\" of the company. The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to continue evaluating Taft and \"will be involved in further discussions relating to the future control and direction\" of the company. The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may decide to sell some or all of its stake.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS. Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March."}

Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F> expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said. He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures."}

Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions told Reuters. NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said. Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.  Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said. Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day. Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.  Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. \"It's just disguised cheating,\" one Japanese trader said. The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore.

Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as \"one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets.\" union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets. \"we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,\" he said. Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield. \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today's agreement,\" adams said. He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins. The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct yield of white products."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR. Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\" Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said, an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. \"It's a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined. The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a \"lock-up\" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding."}

Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to be more than 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos but Paris traders were more precise by forecasting a rebate level of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus. London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers over the threatened action by the producers to move over 800,000 tonnes to intervention. Last week saw 60,500 tonnes whites athuorised for export at a maximum rebate of 44.819 Ecus per 100 kilos."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE. Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. \"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,\" he said. \"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,\" he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. \"The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,\" he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets. \"They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation,\" he said. \"Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad.\""}

Lucky Stores Inc said it and investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting securities. The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said. The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said. In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the company said. Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting power of substantial Lucky stockholders. Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock, last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company. Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own common shares and reincorporation in Delaware. The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program. Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and restructuring plan. Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other costs. \"This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and the accompanying demands on management time,\" Lucky Stores chairman John Lillie said in a statement."}

A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association, told Reuters. Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no limit. Since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month. \"Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top,\" Arango said in an interview. \"Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away,\" he added. Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in Colombia's coffee marketing policy. The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).

We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,\" Markey said. \"The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing.\" Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry. \"Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders,\" Shad said in his statement.

GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at 90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day. In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended. General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted. It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp shares. General Partners said it would set up voting trust arrangements pending review of its long-form application for FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's broadcasting subsidiary. The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for minority shareholders to elect directors. General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer. GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs. Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire &lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private for 1.66 billion dlrs. GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign payments and political contributions. GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER. New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term."}
{"label": "acq", "text": "PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>. New Jersey-based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc, will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called \"bridge\" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said. \"Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future,\" said Idsal. William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions. The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended."}

Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T. The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT. The result of the negotiations was still open. Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer. The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the U.S. Baur said he expected the French government to decide on the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct. The French government has limited CGCT participation by foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs for the whole company. Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology. Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT. Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre with was also being planned."}

Trade estimates of the coming May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago. Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier. Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing. Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags. The traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment. Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices. If such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease. Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant. The traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month, September. Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good."}

The main factor in the January revision was contracts and orders for plant and equipment, the department said. December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier 2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.

Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine the move's pricing, Honeywell said. Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's restructuring. \"As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense, Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and financial resources on high market share business,\" Spencer said. Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S. governement. Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on a cost basis, recording any dividends as received. Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product line and build its business in integrated systems for networking, database management and transaction processing. The new company said its board will have nine members, including the chairman and chief executive officer. Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the new company, which began worldwide operations today, said. It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president and chief executive officer."}

Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences, said he was pleased with the latest gathering here. Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal. \"Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,\" he added in an interview with Reuters. \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said. Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the world trade system. Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive. He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples. He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries.

With the April 15 tax return deadline less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes. Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a \"bonanza,\" analysts say. \"For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice President Tom Bloch said in an interview. \"When Congress drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers benefit,\" Bloch said. \"Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'\" he said. \"Tax forms will look very different next year,\" he added. Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987 earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs. \"Next year, Block could have a bonanza,\" Buchbinder said. Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns, up 1.5 pct over the previous year. The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according to the IRS. For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide, there are some changes in the act that will have a negative effect, Bloch conceded. Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the tax rolls, he said. Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73 dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he said. Block expects \"some expansion\" this tax season of its electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted. The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in the 1986 tax season. First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988. Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for television ads. \"They may get a little more bang for their buck,\" he said. He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could be of great benefit to them."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS. Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below. Stoltenberg said: \"We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.\""}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR. French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction."}

Liquidity in the Philippines rose in December while loan demand and short-term lending rates fell, the Central Bank said. A bank official said M-3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional 149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a month earlier for a year-on-year gain of 12.72 pct. She said short-term bank lending rates fell to an annualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct a month earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985. Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial bank reserves, the official said.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris. Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals. Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen. The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added."}

The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES. This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range,\" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. \"If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS. Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said. The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1 billion dlrs. The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961. The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said. In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses. Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue. \"I don't remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area,\" FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters. He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance. Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue. On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said. Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago. Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said. Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks. He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected. But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES. Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies. Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian coast last night. If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued. The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives. The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914 when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada. The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945. In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and 147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES. &lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;United Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said. Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\" De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan."}

Spain has revised some of its main economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its monthly bulletin. Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct. Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986. The forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct. Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct. Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand. Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year. The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended five pct ceiling.

The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country. Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986. Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars. Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said. Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash. Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties. The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS. Japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said. The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access. Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food. Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show. The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances. The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said. The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said. This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said. To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS. The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year."}

Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said. But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said. BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, &lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners. BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9 pct of &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and five pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG. These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions."}

The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985. The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985. On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show. On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter. The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively. Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter. The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.

{"label": "crude", "text": "EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING. OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.

{"label": "crude", "text": "AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES. The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said. He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS. European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,\" Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC. Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. \"We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,\" Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. \"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,\" Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. \"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,\" he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although \"no hypothesis has been abandoned.\" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April."}

Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter. In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985. In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the company, adding, \"While all this was going on, our continuing businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating profit improvement over 1985.\" Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs. Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985. Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in the year. The company's specialties and services segment cut its losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs. Eliminations of business conducted between the company's industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter 1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six mln dlrs in the year. The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year. Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501 mln dlrs. By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs. At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln dlrs from 168 mln dlrs. The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at year end from 430 mln dlrs at year end 1985, after a net decrease of 131 mln dlrs during 1986. Current assets at year-end fell to 2.41 billion dlrs from 4.43 billion dlrs and current liabilities fell to 1.88 billion dlrs from 2.38 billion."}

Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners.

Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which Placer has an option with &lt;Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement. Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of Perth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month. Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground. It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE. Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy,\" he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume. \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,\" he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.\" Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. \"There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,\" he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil's current quota \"reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY. The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict."}

The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said. It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels. The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget. The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers. \"The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,\" it added. The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced."}

Algerian and Spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said. The agreement was made during a meeting here last week between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the market situation. The two firms \"took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made,\" a statement by ENOF said. The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms' production costs. \"They have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar, which is close to their production cost,\" the statement said. It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in Madrid later this month. The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week."}

{"label": "ipi", "text": "CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U.K. OUTPUT. British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows. The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March. On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February. From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier. Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports. \"But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home,\" he said."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER. A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus \"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,\" one official said. \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said."}

The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions. The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements. The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors. Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price. Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges. The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley. In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March 13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD. World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth. \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time,\" he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.\" The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy. \"We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\" Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.\" Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities. \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,\" Conable said. However, he said \"I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.\" He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.\" He added, \"so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution.\" On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT. A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct. \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said. The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure."}

A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the investors. Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital Corp &lt;NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan, declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the Entertainment Group. \"We are considering selling the group,\" Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood film studios which might be interested. Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12 pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families. Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but continues as vice chairman of the company. Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by March 12. If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said. Narragansett is an investment management company specializing in leveraged buyout transactions. Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to say investors believe the bidders may raise their price. Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return telephohe calls seeking comment. But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said \"I don't think it's worth 150 dlrs.\" He noted Taft recently agreed to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss. He said the entertainment group, which includes the Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a glut of animated product. Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the company. MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the company with a distribution of various pieces to the major shareholders among the possibilities. Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the belief the company would be worth more with a change in its strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent television stations because the company paid too much."}

Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.

The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security. The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries. Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year. \"This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the Washington Democrat said. The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls. Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments. It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN. The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,\" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said. O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration. A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs, to go through as planned later today. The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment. The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles. \"Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,\" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night. \"There was really very little that remained to be done.\" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place. The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company. After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new Delta outfits. Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night. At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines. While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members. Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be \"extinguished\" after today."}

Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.

The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. \"We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices,\" Melnikov said. \"I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement....

{"label": "lumber", "text": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers."}

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said. Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\" They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the whirlwind to visit elsewhere,\" he added."}

U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.8 pct of capacity in February, compared with a revised 79.6 pct in January and December, the Federal reserve Board said. The Fed previously said the rate was 79.7 pct in January and 79.5 pct in December. A surge in automobile assemblies in February and a gain in primary metals production helped raise manufacturing to 80.1 pct capacity from 79.9 pct in January. Durables manufacturing increased to 76.8 pct last month from 76.3 pct in January, the Fed said. Nondurable manufacturing eased to 85.2 pct of capacity use from 85.4 pct in January. Last month's rate was down from 80.2 pct in February, 1986. Fabricated metals increased to 81.4 pct in February from 81.2 pct in January, while motor vehicles and parts jumped to 83.6 pct from 80.0 in January. Primary metals rose to 67.7 pct from 66.7 pct in January. Petroleum products fell to 92.5 pct in February from 94.5 pct in January. Capacity utilization for mining rose to 75.3 pct in February from 75.1 pct in January, but was below the February 1986 rate of 79.4 pct, the Fed said. The use rate for utilities was up to 80.8 pct last month from 80.4 pct in January. Producers of industrial materials operated at 78.9 pct of capacity, the same as in January and December, but down from the February 1986 rate of 79.6 pct.

Trade is the most urgent problem facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark, Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said. Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement. \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.\" Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October. He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington. On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes. \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he said. Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said. \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,\" he said. In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada. Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions. \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,\" he said. In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. \"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,\" he said.

{"label": "earn", "text": "PORSCHE EXPECTS IMPROVEMENT IN U.S. SALES. Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher. Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from 11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000 from 28,670 last year. Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86. For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254, Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added. The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S. Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period. The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit, the Porsche board said. In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki. Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln marks. In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for the first time. Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS. American Telephone and Telegraph Co's proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it should help the company's profits, analysts said. \"Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large volume users, but status quo for residential users,\" said PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman. But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has constrained the company's profits in the long distance business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said. ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct. Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to its competitors to oppose it filings. MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition in the telephone business. Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in the industry, simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces. \"You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,\" said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. \"But you wouldn't see a rise.\" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. \"It will give ATT a lot more flexibility,\" he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC hearings. It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>. \"We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,\" a U.S. Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed to greater competition. It may also take some time for the proposals to go through, and in the process they may be altered by the various constituencies affected by the move. \"There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it won't happen that fast,\" said analyst Victor Krueger of the Gartner Group."}

Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year's pace, economists said. \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month. The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets. Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges. \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987. The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct. Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture. \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week. The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on Monday. While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks, the official said. Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday. The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world's cocoa exporters and consumers. He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March 27. The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses. Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices."}

Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference. Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's \"strategic aims.\" He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus point\" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe. Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year."}

Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.

In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln \"due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations,\" Guilbaud said.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS. Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\" \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\" He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate."}

BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax. Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price. \"In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations,\" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM. West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said. The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said. Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. \"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study. It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar. West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline. \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November. Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package. The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing. The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CAROLINA POWER &lt;CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT. Carolina Power and Light Co said its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C. The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in 1992. Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under review because of a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission that would have required the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing scrubbers. Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers through the use of low-sulphur coal, and \"The addition of scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal air quality improvements.\" The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later development of a generating unit. Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about 877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  \"The higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.\" A company spokesman said the company has already spent about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings it will make late this year or early next year."}

Production of fish meal by the three South American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- last year reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of 1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers (IAFMM) said. However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru in the same month. The statement added that, due to technical market promotion and energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position at the end of the year remained reasonable. Fish meal production outside South America decreased slightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes. The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West Germany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the Far East, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K. It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from competition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmed milk powder in the U.K. IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producing nations, in thousands of tonnes, were - Oct/Dec            Jan/Dec 1986    1985       1986     1985 CHILE             22       8        109       76 PERU              56      28        238      104 NORWAY            14      14         97      130 ICELAND           44      52        102      118 DENMARK           20      18         88       77 U.S.              10       8        152      129 JAPAN             67      91        213      249"}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAJOR DIFFERENCES RESOLVED AT RUBBER PACT TALKS. Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said. \"We have resolved major differences of opinion,\" he told Reuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord, to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since the talks began last Monday. \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement,\" he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock. The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Britain are the major consumers. UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988."}

Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want. But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future. Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.

The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. \"The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise,\" he said. He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation."}

In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS. Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult. \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They're well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said. \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" said Edwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter. In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before. - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low. - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan. - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand.\" - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five billion yen, a company official said."}

Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry said. The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986. But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand. Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. \"This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps,\" he said. The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added. Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service. Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's exporters. Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said."}

Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials \"do not believe this will result in a trade war.\" \"It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about,\" the presidential spokesman added. \"We do not want protectionism ...

{"label": "acq", "text": "AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF. American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very profitable securities firm.\" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,\" said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. \"They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way,\" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985."}

ChemLawn Corp said its board rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares. ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value. ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or \"poison pill,\" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers. ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and other relief. The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules. Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs. ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders, and could \"adversely affect\" the interests of its employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers. \"Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their shares to Waste Management,\" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen. ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect shareholders against abusive tactics, such as \"market accumulations by Waste Management or others.\" Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn common. ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board. It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time prior to their exercise date.

Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs."}

Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention here, Yeutter said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" the controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers. Yeutter said the proposed tax is a \"flagrant violation of the spirit of GATT\" because it would imperil the zero binding duty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe.

Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign. However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2 mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes. The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the official said."}

Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor operations. The company said the rising political controversy in the U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable time. The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security grounds. The company said termination of the agreement opened other possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the semiconductor maker by Fairchild management. In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern said. Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year. Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about 200 mln dlrs. The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations about the transaction since it was announced. Government officials have expressed concern that the sale could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting key advanced technology into Japanese hands.

TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit to block Coastal from taking control. Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court. Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an undisclosed amount. TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about one billion dlrs. The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines. About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.

Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said. The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added. On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter. The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak. Bank economists have forecast the economy will either stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official first-quarter figures are due in early June."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION. &lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said. First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,\" Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies. \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\" Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations \"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. \"The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we don't think the international markets are well-served.\" Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had to be there.\" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.\" Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. \"That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,\" said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.\" He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said."}

The federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe. The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time. \"To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation\" in connection with the TRE bid, he said. A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added: \"We had nothing to do with TRE.\" As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING. OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. \"We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA. Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment. The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances. It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry."}

Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and full year earnings from ongoing operations should be \"significantly above 1986 results.\" In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend in the foreseeable future. He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market continues to point to little or no change. But recent order receipts indicate a \"firmer tone in the heavy duty truck segment,\" which could result in a five to eight pct increase in industry shipments for the full year, he said. After restructuring under the holding company format, the company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as Navistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer currently president and chief operating officer of Navistar International was named chairman of the new subsidiary. James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial officer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief executive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will retire March 31. Shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the company's structure to a holding company format, to be effective April 1."}

Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's &lt;RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. The company said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.

The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. \"With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines,\" Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period \"we could get away without having to increase the quota.\" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request. Following the refiners' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said. Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group. Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said \"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration.\""}

His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets.

{"label": "interest", "text": "AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT. Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue. Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries. But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first. Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank."}

Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low. GenCorp has made no comment on the offer. Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges. \"One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to the meeting and putting up \"no greenmail,\" Gabelli said. Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation in the offer. The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "NORSTAR &lt;NOR>, FLEET &lt;FLT> OUTLINE MERGER. Fleet Financial Group said that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company. Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split. The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding. Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect. For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y. holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs. Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company's stock holders, the company said. For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share. In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding. The transaction is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval. The companies said that after the proposed merger, the combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the country."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY. The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better."}

U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, a spokesman for Lloyds of London said. It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds. The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>. The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said. Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies. Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death. Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved. Larner said estimates of compensation claims \"were pure guess work\" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.

Engineering group Linde AG's &lt;LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said. But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct. Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln. Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln. Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks. Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details. While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks. Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks. The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks. Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks and incoming orders increased 1.9 pct to 2.92 billion marks. The company was producing at full capacity in 1986."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE. Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. \"We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,\" Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.\" He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment."}

Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase by \"substantially more\" than the 30 pct average annual growth experienced in the last four years. Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts. Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs, or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs. De Groote also said the company expects \"excellent results\" in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more specific. He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990. De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The rest came from acquisitions, he said. Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation, a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said. He also said he is \"not very optimistic\" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary. De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp. \"We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management,\" de Groote said. Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S. subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing. De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants. De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct. The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it, he said. He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely within the next few months."}

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, \"If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.\" MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.

{"label": "acq", "text": "FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION. Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, \"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible.\" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, \"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that.\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \"opportunistic\". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources. The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us.\" Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, \"a very, very difficult decision.\" With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community. \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said. Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said. He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, \"I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years.\" Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's franchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\" Pinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two.\" On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements.\" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981."}

The new method was first used for the January figures, which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce from 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the change had apparently not been noticed by the press.

{"label": "interest", "text": "THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT. Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said. They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said. Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said. Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct. Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market."}

Utilicorp United Corp said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about 12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about 190 mln dlrs. In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5 mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs. There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the 8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green told financial analysts here. First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1, 1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts. Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said. However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized in September 1986, he noted. Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas operations, he said. Operating income derived from electric operations in the first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs, while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln dlrs, Green said. Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one. Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval process, he said. Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the British Columbia Utilities Commission on the 60 mln dlrs purchase by Utilicorp is pending, he said."}

The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION. External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute. In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments. Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected. \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said. Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S. \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies. \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\""}

U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said \"in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.\" But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural industries\" - publishing, broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, \"acid rain\" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage."}

There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. \"There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet,\" he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" (or \"must sell\") levels without changing the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the \"lower indicative price\" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact."}

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said. Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\" They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

He told securities analysts that when the company's common dividend is resumed, \"the initial rate will appear conservative to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income and cash flow.\" \"Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a dividend to our common stockholders, he said.\" The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share in July 1985.

Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, energy industry analysts said. Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt, analysts said. \"The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named. Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale \"at the right price.\" Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10 billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The Encor shares do not pay dividends. A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake. At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs. Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said. \"Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented. \"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years,\" he added. Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six dlrs in early February. The company also recently set up its own operating management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum, Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented. Dome and Encor \"are actually going to get farther apart. So (the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said. However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to Commerce Bank. \"I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber. Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets. \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert. Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration. Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines. Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's debt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's holding. Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company's debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said. Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares, but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are very attractive.\""}

{"label": "acq", "text": "PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID. Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be \"highly desirable and appropriate at this time.\" \"That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share,\" said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. \"I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment,\" Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. \"I think it's much more doable,\" he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs."}

Resorts International Inc said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be formed through the takeover. Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of common stock in the new company. Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware corporation. Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220 mln dlrs of equity. It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of special preferred stock. The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special preferred stock. Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27. It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co, to advise its board on the offer. Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the 752,297 class B shares outstanding. Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining class B shares outstanding. Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting power of the class B shares. Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>. Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire Resorts. Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the special preferred stock would immediately be converted into exchangeable participating preferred of the new company. This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island operations. A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said. The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman. Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was not immediately available for comment.

The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel products. Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd and other investors. Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding. For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq said. Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here. The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.

The cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of \"negative inflation\" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said. The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report. The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier. The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel."}

A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security.

The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules. The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade. Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round. \"The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy,\" Smith said. \"Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.\" He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies. Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics. \"We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,\" he said. GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement.

Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May. Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57 mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.

Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said. Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc. High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank. \"It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,\" one banker said. Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil's debt stance."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY. Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels. \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules."}

The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. \"Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.\" He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. \"That's a very healthy development,\" he added.\"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.\" \"Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,\" Yeutter said. \"They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.\" He added, \"Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.\""}

More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a \"zero certificate case,\" where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled \"adequate certificate case\" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case. The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs. The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined. The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash."}

Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME. In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis. Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said. By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex. The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said. The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29.

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 228 MLN DLRS. U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said. Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs. The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported. A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period. None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large regionals and the small banks. Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday -- for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason -- to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday. The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of transportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting that the weather was \"basically good\" for March, the spokesman said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a day for the full week. Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error corrections in five districts. As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday."}
{"label": "gold", "text": "NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD. A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.\" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.\" The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,\" he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high,\" he said."}

The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.

{"label": "earn", "text": "WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH. Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE. A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share. In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks' own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board, to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in. A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers. Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems. \"We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,\" he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said. Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies, worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares. However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company's statutes. Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament. \"People buying, for example, more than five pct of a company's shares should be made to declare their purchase,\" he said."}

The Treasury proposed allowing temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last fall. The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next week requests written congressional and public comment within 60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries. The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry. \"The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the act,\" the Treasury brief said. The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including the Soviet Union for processing. Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export \"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\" The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the United States. \"The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made under bond,\" the brief said.

Australia's largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters said. This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said. They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "U.S. SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987. Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good. Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota. Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year. USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report. The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are \"just awful,\" said Carter. In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association. \"The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,\" Markwart said. In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said. USDA's report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good. Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze. Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year, cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said. In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association. The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said. The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said. \"We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years,\" said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year. Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987."}

Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. \"The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,\" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said \"it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number.\" \"We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,\" she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC. European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic. The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn. It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports. But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels. \"Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic,\" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting. The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe. But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy. The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY. Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said."}

Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. \"The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen.\" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radical elimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.

{"label": "earn", "text": "GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER. One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no one order will have much of an effect on the stock.\" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order \"will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting \"significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.\""}
{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP &lt;PCC>. Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company, traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265 mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division's management. The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one. Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he personally owns 20,000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again. \"There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question of management's willingness to let the process continue,\" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction. Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S. courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in Purolator. \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero. One always likes a situation like that. You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one arbitrager. The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some risk to the firm. \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash, and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to employees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called \"bridge\" financing for the transaction. The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing, expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale. \"It's a very complex transaction, but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place,\" Gardner said."}

Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing. Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting against \"what appears to be a clear violation of the law.\" Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock. But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday. The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it lacked the necessary data for the government to review the proposed USAir takeover bid. Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday. Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation were found."}

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.\""}

{"label": "acq", "text": "ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION. Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws. Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports. Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" shares of stock. In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert. Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc."}

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. \"Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,\" one dealer said. Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. \"We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already,\" one eurosterling specialist said. \"Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money,\" he added. This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations. Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields. A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest. This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat. \"We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market,\" Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told Reuters."}

French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the European Community (EC).

Raimond, due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the semi-official daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached. \"I am confident that problems between the two big partners, the GCC and the EC, will find a solution.

An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides. GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached. Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added: \"Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress.\" Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties. He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved.

Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks."}

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc. \"The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,\" the DOT said in a statement. AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb. 20. American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not alter American's third-place ranking, according to data compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine. The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S. market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said. The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single-plane service. At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American-AirCal. Concerning the 14th, \"While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area, especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long-haul markets,\" the DOT said. The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion. The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but \"raised no new facts or arguments.\" Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings."}

OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: \"OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. \"For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,\" Al-Wattari said. \"Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. \"The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation,\" he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale."}

Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said. \"This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,\" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry. The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks. \"It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.

{"label": "trade", "text": "STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES. A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage. Wonnacott said \"bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers. He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production. Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product. Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK COMPROMISE GAINING ACCEPTANCE. A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said. \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"no problems\" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as \"just fiddling.\" But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY OPTIMISTIC ON INCENTIVES. U.S. Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was \"optimistic\" about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration. Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was \"heavy and strong\" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry. Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports. In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp &lt;MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. \"We intend to keep that debate open,\" Herrington said. However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee \"is not economical.\" Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs. Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry. \"I'm quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it,\" Herrington said."}

Tenneco Inc, a company that has long been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts said. Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said \"we have no comment to make whatsoever.\" Pickens was not available for comment. Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco. Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4. Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt. \"It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his group may be interested,\" Feretti said. \"But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a challenge.\" Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said. Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at 58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of about 10 dlrs a share \"which is probably very attractive to Pickens.\" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value well into the 60 dlr a share range. \"I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile takeover,\" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors. \"Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding.\" He said the buyer would also have to deal with \"the intractable problems\" Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses. Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership out of its natural gas pipeline interests. An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged the Pickens rumor. \"Pickens has a plateful already with his holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,\" he said. \"I don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion dlrs on the market today.\""}

Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake. Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said. Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five  months. Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired. Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd."}

The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price, and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be followed by a merger at the same price. USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances. Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding. USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain control of Piedmont. The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent. USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be satisfied. In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.

{"label": "interest", "text": "WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES. West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period. A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F> and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally. The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks. A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate. The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct. Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW TURNING INTO TRADE WAR. Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. Of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. Action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping."}

The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, \"I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned.\" \"It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed.\" He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic \"that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled.\" Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, \"There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement.\""}

At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. \"We are waiting to see what consumers say,\" a producer delegate said. \"We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate.\" The ICCO comprises 33 member countries.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY. Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad."}

A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution. A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out. Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour. The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>. The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies estimated to be trapped amid debris. \"The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect one working day out of four,\" said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam.

Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicle loading doors, set close to water level. In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed. Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added. Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun, one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST. International Business Machines Corp, hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said. \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not until later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm. Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending. IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs. Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company itself, have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM's growth. But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view. \"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said of DEC's line of VAX computers. In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said. Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business.\" He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988. High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said. By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs. Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area. In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than stealing market share from one another."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN. The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a \"bear\" market. \"It's the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets. \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\" said O'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\" Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  \"We're still in a bull market,\" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The bear usually strikes slowly.\" Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London. He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark. In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets."}

Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said. Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986. A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected. Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts. He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO. He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987. Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement."}
{"label": "acq", "text": "HUGHES &lt;HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO>. An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were \"several people looking\" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects \"substantial cutbacks\" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. \"We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven,\" he said. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs. Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs."}

Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis. \"Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product,\" Denman said. He said in the case of textiles import restrictions, however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports. \"Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe,\" Denman said. He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs. \"This would conflict with international obligations, throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang,\" he warned of the tariff proposals. Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors. \"Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party,\" he said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another."}

Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's interstate banking law becomes operational. Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of the Hemingway family who own about 30 pct of Commercial Security's outstanding shares have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction and not dispose of their stock.

About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday. The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday. The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY. The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted. The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said. Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said. \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145."}

The strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry. The miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but \"only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands\", Aranibar said. The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of West German president, Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives today for a four-day official visit.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved USAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to acquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to sell the excess within one week. USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1 pct on a fully diluted basis. The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394 Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's application to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way."}

Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share, reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant revenues. The accounting change will not affect the company's cash position and the company intends to continue paying its dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share. Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or 2.60 dlrs per share. Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project. It said the commission is currently allowing the company to recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants. As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been included in current income. But the accounting change, effective January 1, will reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said. It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the 5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to recover in rates. The company further stated that it is confident it will receive an objective review of the facts. It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates. Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in March last year."}

The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company's stock. The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire 5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14 dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday. Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata's common stock.

However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts. Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results. The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government's Inspector General of Banks. First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs. Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter. The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end. \"Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings prior to the announcement,\" Commerce bank said.

{"label": "copper", "text": "ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA. Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said. The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\" According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat said. \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,\" he added."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES. Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week. \"We got a little volatility Wednesday,\" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. \"But for the moment we're still in a trading range.\" Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said. \"It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. \"It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,\" he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace. \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said. \"We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,\" compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said. In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures. The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures. \"I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the trading range),\" Lacey said."}

The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad. The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said. Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China. Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier. Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct. Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct. Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct."}

William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming \"one of the world's industrial lightweights.\" Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry. Bywater said, \"I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\""}

The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show. The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below the same month last year. Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion. Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth. Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil. In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period. This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government's program for economic growth, Fendt added."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR. The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. \"The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates,\" he said. The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said. Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said."}

An investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting. \"We might be able to see some additional value if we could meet\" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for the investor group. Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds \"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time.\" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with Reynolds, Reed said. Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs. Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE. Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be more viable if merged with another tire company. \"One option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition,\" Reed said. He said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry. Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success, he said. In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations, Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations. The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs. The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would get about 103 mln dlrs. The partners also said the Federal Communications Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit. Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer. He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations. Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is headquartered, Reed said, \"the plan of the partners offers long term growth for Ohio.\" He noted that the aerospace business, slated for divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California. \"Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments,\" he said."}

A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round,\" he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. \"It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said. \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said."}

A Portland-based wood products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq, Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said yesterday. Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs. The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity under the credit guarantee program, he said. Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by Scandinavian lumber producers. \"This is the first time we have been able to sell wood products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term export market for U.S. lumber products.\" He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing, construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six pct. Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale late last month and early March. He is a member of the United States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to promote commerce with Iraq. The forum members include Westinghouse and General Electric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood products firm on the membership roster."}

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.

Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries.

{"label": "earn", "text": "MELLON &lt;MEL> SEES LARGE FIRST-QUARTER LOSS. Mellon Bank Corp said it expects to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share. The company also said it intends to reduce its second quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss reserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and increased provisions address four areas of concern in the bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector, developing countries, some basic industrial companies and several commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of total loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23 pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45 billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with 928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year, especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. \"This action relates both to loans to companies directly involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers, home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern United States,\" Barnes said. As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties, Barnes said. \"We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them aggressively,\" he added."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING. The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987. The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said."}

Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected."}

Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited."}

Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\" Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said. \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd. Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions."}

Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,\"  Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS. Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said. \"We don't intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability.\" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, \"The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.\""}

{"label": "grain", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND. \"If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on.\" Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years. \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up.\" \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year. \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures. \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it said. \"China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient.\" An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government. The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops. To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it. Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices. Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city grain prices without any problem. But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month. The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\" The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents. In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular. The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes. Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land. \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month. Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative. \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment,\" the newspaper said."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL. A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, told Reuters. Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague. The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country. Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board. The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10. The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the company is not being made public. The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg, and \"as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.\" Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said. Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS. Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it is time to go and sell coffee.\" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said."}

Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.

Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW BECOMING TRADE WAR. Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping."}

Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself. The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 -- was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986. Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for the shares although it expected to buy them back itself. The statement said the sale did not represent any withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main shareholders. Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made. Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue. Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results. Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner &lt;Industrivarden AB>. The share price was to be 20 crowns.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL. Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. \"In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,\" Cardenas said."}

First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it expected operating losses to continue \"for the foreseeable future\" as it continues to search for additional capital or a merger partner. The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co. The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City eventually obtaining additional capital. \"The company believes that in order to address its long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more strongly capitalized entity,\" First City said in a note to its financial statements included in the annual report. \"Management believes that sufficient resources should be available to cover interim capital concerns while additional capital is being sought,\" the bank said. To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of its member banks. \"The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986,\" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter included in the annual report. \"However, the ultimate return to satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the successful resolution of the related problems of credit quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial additional capital.\" First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid default. The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120 mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks. Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986, First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of 5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio. Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of 1986. First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs \"should be more modest.\" The amount represented 15 pct of First City's total loans. In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end. Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount could go higher. \"The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists,\" First City said. \"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of real estate-related chargeoffs.\""}

Increased activity by Switzerland's banks pushed net capital exports to a provisional 11.7 billion francs last year from 10.0 billion in 1985, the National Bank said in a pre-publication copy of its annual report. It also said the current account surplus of the Swiss balance of payments reached a provisional 13.5 billion francs last year, from 12.8 billion in 1985. The National Bank's currency reserves rose by 1.8 billion francs, against a 2.8 billion rise in 1985. However, taking into accounts effects of the shift in exchange rates, reserves actually fell in value by 1.9 billion.

A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.\" But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. \"It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said. \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said."}

There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.

His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.

For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed like an \"appropriate price.\" Another said \"it's too early to project the outcome.\" \"The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate,\" the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today. He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV. Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17. A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. \"They're not beginners,\" he said. Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. \"It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,\" he said. \"There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it's presently structured.\" Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software, aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding equipment and other products. \"I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk,\" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at Milwaukee Co. He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV \"fair value but on the low side.\" \"I don't think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer,\" he said.

A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.

Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it becomes final, the company said. The board also took other defensive steps, including granting severance agreements to some officers, it said. At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to remove directors without cause, the company said. The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said. Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given severance agreements, or \"golden parachutes,\" it said. Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906 dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the company's voting stock, Conrac said. Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing. The executives would also get cash settlements of options plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. \"We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,\" he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.\" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,\" Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit."}

Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said. Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.

The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men's clothing, was responsible for the advance.

Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. \"The situation is unchanged,\" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. \"As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting.\" At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using \"objective criteria,\" which would likely have reduced Brazil's share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. \"As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags,\" he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said.

A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption."}

On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels,\" Krapels said. But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling.

Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged from today onward. \"We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value offer in cash for the Southern Pacific,\" said Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H. Rowland. \"This offer disproves the constant derogation of the Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'\" said Rowland. He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime competitor, Santa Fe. Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1.2 billion dlrs. It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations. Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for Southern after its books, records and properties are examined. \"Once that examination has been completed (and even in the absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an offer in writing....\" said the company. Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes. ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and other railroads, adds to the value of the merger."}

The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other measures intended to influence Fairchild management and policies, either alone or in concert with other investors. The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles that is advised by Soros. The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2, it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold 6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.

{"label": "trade", "text": "INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP. India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission."}

Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. \"The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week,\" Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said.

Westinghouse Electric Corp said earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be in the double digit range through 1989. In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues of 10.7 billion dlrs. Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, \"given an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth course.\" He also said the company will make acquisitions, but he did not specify particular targets. Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the analysts \"our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one. Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will consider it.\" He said the company would consider an acquisition candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's primiary businesses. Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key areas including defense electronics, financial services, broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction and industrial and utility markets. Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow faster than the markets the corportation serves and \"surely faster than GNP.\" He said earnings per share growth is expected to consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range. Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance, told the analysts \"we will consider buying back stock\" but there are no current plans for such a buyback. Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder value. Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation, assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344 mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in 1988.

Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said."}

While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar.\""}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>. Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate, analysts said. Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention. Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory limbo. Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over 25 pct. \"This gives them plenty of borrowing power,\" he said, which could be used against an unwanted suitor. Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs. Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover. \"I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern,\" one Santa Fe executive said about Henley. \"I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe,\" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers Henley for DLJ Securities. Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo, sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future. These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment. The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad. Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds. The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to merge the lines. \"My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings,\" Fischer said. \"I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's objections,\" he said. \"But in doing so they haven't pleased everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side, now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up.\" If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up to another year for the ICC to decide. Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a spokesman said. Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said. James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake. \"It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low-risk, opportunistic investment,\" Voytko said. \"People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share,\" said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. \"But I'm certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than that in breakup value.\""}

The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding. On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator. But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own. Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28, unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate, payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued, interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in additional notes, Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company. \"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future,\" Emery's chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer, which was released several hours after the stock market had closed. Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8. Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8."}

The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs, or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost 1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. \"Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter,\" he said. Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of Japan. Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc, is developing software that lets large maniframe computers handle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major corporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staff cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff instead of straight commissions, Shattner said. And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth fiscal quarter, Shattner said."}

{"label": "gold", "text": "PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING. A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\" Hofer said. \"I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,\" he added. Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES. The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market. Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. \"The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments,\" Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said. \"The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country,\" one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week,\" Korkman told Reuters. He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS. The Bundesbank's options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement."}

The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,\" Ebinger said. He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting. \"Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests,\" Ebinger said. Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring. But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring. There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June. He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production. OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said. OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months. Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd."}

Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.

While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices. The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level, adding that \"It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level.\" He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. \"There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,\" Lawson said.  He disagreed with what he termed \"the grossly exaggerated claim\" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation.\" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\""}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,\" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION. Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. \"Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,\" Wellemeyer said. \"The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,\" he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take \"appropriate measures\" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. \"It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date,\" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise."}

The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs.

February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986. The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74 billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99 billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said. It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels. On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the Bureau said. The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year earlier, the Bureau said.

US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT> set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year. David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\" He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over \"two plus years\" to set up its network.  Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines. He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are operable. By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter. Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter. \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland said. He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct. Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year. At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January. \"We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,\" he said. Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.\" \"They're so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition in the marketplace.\" \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he said, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.\" Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings. \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he was \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. \"There's no evidence of that,\" he said. He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead in many areas.\" Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988. \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said. He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it. He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone network."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN SAYS U.S.-JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING. Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case. \"We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,\" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters. \"The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,\" he said. U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said. \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. \"I am optimistic,\" he added."}

U.S. personal income rose 0.9 pct, or 32.4 billion dlrs, in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,581.3 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personal income during January. Earlier, the department estimated January personal income was unchanged. The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase since a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. It attributed last month's rise to several factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises. The department said personal consumption expenditures were up during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9 billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct in January. Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs last month after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January with sales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February increase and the January decline, the department said. Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in February after a 300 mln dlr increase in January. The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were up 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr rise in January. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs last month after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gains widespread through durable and nondurable industries, the department said. Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in February after declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both last month's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was because of government subsidy payments, the department said. Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs in February following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes. Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up 1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after rising 25.8 billion dlrs in January. The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February from four pct in January, the department said."}

The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full bid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between BIL and Rainbow. BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.

The International Sugar Agreement (ISA) will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact's council.

The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses, he said. But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget. At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact. The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "SRI LANKA TO UPROOT OR BUD DISEASED RUBBER TREES. Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned. The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN 2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058. Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102. These six varieties would also be used to replace trees uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said. Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge. \"But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,\" he added. De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the spread of the disease. \"The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably helped in some way because trees have not been affected in areas that are dry,\" he said. Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it has not caused a drop in production. Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last week firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at the previous sale."}

In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7, producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.

A British source, who declined to be identified further, said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion. \"It's probably a sensible approach on their part,\" the British source told reuters. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms. The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London. The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans, saying that both rival consortia should be licensed. Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms, Watanabe said, \"They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate.\" Under the Japanese law, total foreign participation would be limited to one-third. \"It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas,\" Watanabe told reporters. The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsui and Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co &lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba \"All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less.\" Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.

{"label": "earn", "text": "BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS. British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L> profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years. He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter's results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's close and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion. Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising prices was limited as long as inflation remains low."}

Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen.

Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at \"international markets\" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports \"was probably about right.\" European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy. Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs. A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details. The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business. In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was \"apparently still organising finance,\" his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630 mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid \"at the date foreseen in the preliminary contract.\" Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by September 30. Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's European business was apparently rejected in favour of Ferruzzi's lower bid. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said \"Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC's European business.\" Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under study, he added. Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC business, Gardini said: \"We do not exclude having minority partners in the CPC business.\" He declined to elaborate."}

Speaking at a news conference, Reviglio said the two projects will eventually bring in some 300 mln dlrs annually in foreign exchange to Venezuela and help diversify the country's export base. \"Joint ventures are the principal instrument for allowing the resources of the industrialized countries to be channeled to the developing world so as to lead future growth for both,\" Reviglio said. ENI's subsidiary Ecofuel will join Pequiven, the petrochemical subsidiary of PDVSA in building a 160 mln dlr plant to produce mtbe, a gasoline additive used to increase octane levels. The 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at Jose in eastern Venezuela, and fed by butane produced at PDVSA's eastern cryogenic complex. ENI owns 48 pct of the joint venture company, Super Octanos, C.A., while Pequiven has 49 pct, with the remaining three pct to be sold to private investors.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN>. Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor. Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more than three mln shares. Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible. Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill. Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> and Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's official. \"It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" said Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications. However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors. Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them. \"I can't put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy's stock. \"It very well could be someone's interested.\" But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time for Wendy's to be sold. \"They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the right time,\" Freedman said. \"If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control the situation,\" Freedman said. \"I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't think it's worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney. Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the \"burger wars\" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's &lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said. Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround. There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be vulnerable to a takeover. James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500. \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants,\" Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in seven quarters,\" he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy's. \"My gut feeling is something's going to happen. I don't know what,\" she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi. Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants."}

The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said. The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985. Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet. The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985. Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers. Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said. Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list. They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said.

The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday. Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival, &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc>, along with &lt;C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both of the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless, arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct, the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless' share, industry analysts said. \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said. \"Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding,\" Whitten said. Western diplomatic sources were more blunt. \"They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share,\" one said. Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business organization) official who has been trying to arrange the merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday, the ministry official said."}
{"label": "cocoa", "text": "LONDON COCOA TRADES AT LOWS BY MIDMORNING. Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said. Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market. Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries. The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers said. The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer close yesterday, dealers said. But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors. Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335. Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches. There was no sign of any origin activity."}

The ICO executive board's regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said. Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated.

Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation, the producer delegates said.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986."}

Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production. The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday.

{"label": "earn", "text": "CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS. Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" said Pulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not.\" Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp &lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, \"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\" Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings.\" Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. \"If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year.\" He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY. The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said. Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. \"The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai,\" he added."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD. OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\" It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices. The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and \"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS. Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. \"We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,\" he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.. Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by \"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS. Employers in Rotterdam's troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters. Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector. The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers' plans for 350 redundancies this year. A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7. Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case. \"We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business, and further delays would do even more damage,\" Zeebregts said.

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES. The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said."}

Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said. Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday. Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct. The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro. Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said. Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. \"Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit,\" he said. \"But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen,\" Rubens Habbema said. A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION. Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. \"We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,\" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. \"At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers said, \"but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene).\" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS. Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: \"The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never.\" Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States. \"The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems,\" he said. He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February."}

American Eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists. World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said. Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia. She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity. The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the open market, Pope said. Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's West German market share at 60 pct. The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said. Competition may also come from new gold coins, including Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT. Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said. Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost. The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA), told Reuters. However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output. \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,\" he said. Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go. \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.\" Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets. An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. \"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.\" In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the London-based International Sugar Organization. Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover. Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply. Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added. Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970. Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985. The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels. Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market. Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000. A national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru's production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain. At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region. Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency. The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year. Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace. Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles. However, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps. Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies. \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting. The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices. GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact. \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre said."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS. The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would \"distort, not support\" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the market where trade buying is not.\" In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY>. The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. \"The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's cooperation,\" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. \"I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,\" said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the \"short-form\" approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station's license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. \"The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non-strategic assets of the company,\" Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about \"greenmail.\" Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock. \"I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore,\" said Rose.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN. The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit. \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years. \"I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,\" Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM. Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,\" he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,\" he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.\" Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\" He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. \"Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.\" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH. Singapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said. The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary of the bank, they said."}

The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said. He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said. But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident."}
