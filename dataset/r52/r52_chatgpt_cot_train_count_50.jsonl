{"label": "gold", "text": "PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING. A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\" Hofer said. \"I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,\" he added. Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided set is \"gold\".

{"label": "crude", "text": "TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN. The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,\" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W.

Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.

{"label": "crude", "text": "IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND. Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is related to the oil industry and the consumption patterns, oil stocks, and production levels, particularly within OECD countries.

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE. The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the issuance of a new government bond tranche by the Bank of England, the market's reaction to this announcement, and the context of interest rate pressures and expectations in the UK.

{"label": "livestock", "text": "ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY. A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked.\" The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.\"", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the given set is \"livestock.\" The story discusses the use of antibiotics in cattle feed and the resulting development of drug-resistant strains of salmonella that can infect humans.

Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said. \"We have resolved major differences of opinion,\" he told Reuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord, to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since the talks began last Monday. \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement,\" he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock.

Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis.

By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.

{"label": "earn", "text": "CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER. Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley. \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's,\" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the financial and operational aspects of Canada's airline industry, including profitability, market share, debt, management, and investment potential, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"earn.\" This topic relates to the earnings and financial performance of companies, which is the central theme of the article.", "prediction": "earn"}
{"label": "trade", "text": "INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY. World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers. \"We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes. \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports. \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world,\" he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS. Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\" \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\" He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most relevant topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story discusses the impact of U.S. sanctions on Poland's economy, the loss of Most Favoured Nation trading status, the subsequent effect on Polish exports and imports, and the broader implications for trade relations.

Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around Mexico's financial reserves, loans, and dealings with international financial institutions and credit facilities, the topic that best fits this news story is \"reserves.\" The story specifically discusses the level of Mexico's reserves reaching eight billion dollars, the effects of capital inflows on these reserves, and related financial strategies and agreements with other countries and organizations.", "prediction": "reserves"}

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett.

Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said. In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest. But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said. The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday.

The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless, arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct, the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless' share, industry analysts said. \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said. \"Political ...

{"label": "jobs", "text": "FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT. The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation. The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program. Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show. The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market. Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the French government's plans to combat long-term unemployment and stimulate the economy.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT. The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\" The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the economic forecast and situation of West Germany, particularly mentioning the gross national product (GNP) growth, exports, domestic consumption, investment spending, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, and fiscal policy.

ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or \"poison pill,\" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers.

Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.

Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.", "rationale": "The topic that best fits the news story provided is \"coffee.\" The story centers around the issues faced by Indonesian coffee exporters, the negotiations over export quotas within the International Coffee Organization, and the positions of various countries on the quota system.", "prediction": "coffee"}

Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident.

{"label": "earn", "text": "TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>. General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.\" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM,\" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which discusses General Motors Corp's share buyback program, stock performance, market share competition, and analysts' earnings estimates, the most relevant topic from the provided set would be:earn (earnings) The story focuses on financial aspects such as share value, dividends, and the company's strategies to enhance shareholder value, which all relate to GM's earnings and financial performance.", "prediction": "earn"}

The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p. A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash alternative. The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations. The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg. Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln. Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares. Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading.

A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln. The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share. The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.

{"label": "earn", "text": "WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH. Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION. External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute. In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments. Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected. \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said. Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S. \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies. \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around a trade dispute between Canada and the United States regarding Canadian potash exports.

{"label": "acq", "text": "FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION. Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, \"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible.\" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, \"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that.\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \"opportunistic\". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources. The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us.\" Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, \"a very, very difficult decision.\" With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community. \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said. Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said. He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, \"I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years.\" Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's franchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\" Pinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two.\" On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.", "rationale": "The news story provided is related to banking and financial services, specifically discussing First Interstate's strategy in acquisitions, potential targets for acquisition, and their efforts to avoid being acquired themselves.

Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES. British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS. Canada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said \"It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world,\" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said \"in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.\" But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural industries\" - publishing, broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, \"acid rain\" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the negotiations between Canada and the U.S. regarding a free trade pact and the reduction of trade barriers, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\"", "prediction": "trade"}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS. One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the impact of actions taken by large German banks on the liquidity of the domestic money market, and how this has affected the call money rate, which is the interest rate on short-term loans that banks give to each other.

U.S. personal income rose 0.9 pct, or 32.4 billion dlrs, in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,581.3 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personal income during January. Earlier, the department estimated January personal income was unchanged. The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase since a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. It attributed last month's rise to several factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises. The department said personal consumption expenditures were up during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9 billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct in January. Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs last month after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January with sales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February increase and the January decline, the department said. Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in February after a 300 mln dlr increase in January. The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were up 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr rise in January. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs last month after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gains widespread through durable and nondurable industries, the department said. Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in February after declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both last month's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was because of government subsidy payments, the department said. Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs in February following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes. Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up 1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after rising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN. The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign is \"instal-debt.\" This story discusses the U.S. government's urging of commercial banks to consider a new proposal from the Philippines regarding the payment of its interest bill, as part of the broader context of Third World debt strategy.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is \"crude,\" as the article discusses the recovery of Canada's oil industry, which is directly related to crude oil prices, the performance of oil companies, and the impact of government aid on the industry.", "prediction": "crude"}

{"label": "earn", "text": "DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987. Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the topic that best fits the description is \"banking,\" which falls under the broader category of \"earn\" in the provided set.

{"label": "trade", "text": "BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM. A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\" His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. \"The more united pressure there could be, the better,\" he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. \"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" he said, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.\" Channon added that \"There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.\" He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better.\" He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.

Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.

Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states.

The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment. The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND. Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD. The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending. Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided list is \"gnp\" (Gross National Product), as the story discusses the performance of the Japanese economy, specifically mentioning the GNP figures and growth rates.

Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit, Wall Street analysts said. \"I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works,\" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with L.F. Rothschild. \"There are unquestionably other buyers out there,\" added Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. \"A lot of companies have looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.\" Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif., and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts said. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>, Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust problems, the analysts added. Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino, Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by Fairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs, because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned companies. \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U.S. government didn't want it,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government's apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems. \"The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. \"That, I think, is the real significance of this.\" Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most suitable topic to assign would be \"acq\" which stands for acquisitions.

{"label": "trade", "text": "NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take \"appropriate measures\" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. \"It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date,\" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise.", "rationale": "The news story discusses a trade dispute between Japan and the United States regarding computer microchips.

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS. Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanese government official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for the news story provided is \"trade.\" The story discusses high-level trade talks between Japan and the U.S., addressing issues related to the trade imbalance, multilateral trade negotiations under GATT, and various economic structures affecting bilateral trade relations.", "prediction": "trade"}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European sugar beet plantings and their implications for sugar production and market dynamics.

{"label": "earn", "text": "COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR. Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\" He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems.

Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.

A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.

U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.

{"label": "crude", "text": "UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS. The \"cross field allowance\" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.", "rationale": "The news story is discussing a tax relief measure related to the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) in the UK, specifically in the context of oil field development.

The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily.

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive. \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\" Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable touch of the budget.\" Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got.

On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations.

CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.

Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.

Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month. Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground. It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.

Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs, or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986. Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company. In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the commission, he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan. \"We have not agreed to anything,\" Guinn said, but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating. Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion. \"(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so,\" he said. \"I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business.\" However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies.

Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, &lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat.

They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.\" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.

Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP>. American Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit, analysts said. American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs. The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks, as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns. The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S. firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks, depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8 times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets. \"I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,\" said Long. \"What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson,\" Long said. \"Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation,\" he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company spokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson. David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first. \"I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have,\" he said. Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement, the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. \"Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital growth,\" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other U.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are interested in the expertise of American brokers. \"Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money. That's a nice marriage,\" he said. Morgan Stanley and Co &lt;MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>. Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer, either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin) Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want to remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle, Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no steps toward a transaction. \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate battles I've seen,\" said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited from that company's restructuring. \"Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per share,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is seeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction. Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however, believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8. \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's current holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business, which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman. Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office equipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\" Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo security guards. It also has an information services business, and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986, earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.

Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation.\" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\"", "rationale": "The news story you provided pertains to a meeting of major industrial nations discussing policies related to currency stabilization, bands not being published to avoid speculation, and the UK's stance on its own currency and interest rates.

{"label": "acq", "text": "SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES. The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.. China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.\" The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said. \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,\" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do.", "rationale": "The topic of this news story is \"trade.\" The story discusses China's call for better trade agreements with the U.S., including the removal of export curbs, favorable trading status, and easing restrictions on high-technology exports.

The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision.

{"label": "earn", "text": "AUDITORS GIVE FIRST CITY &lt;FBT> QUALIFIED OPINION. First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it expected operating losses to continue \"for the foreseeable future\" as it continues to search for additional capital or a merger partner. The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co. The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City eventually obtaining additional capital. \"The company believes that in order to address its long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more strongly capitalized entity,\" First City said in a note to its financial statements included in the annual report. \"Management believes that sufficient resources should be available to cover interim capital concerns while additional capital is being sought,\" the bank said. To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of its member banks. \"The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986,\" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter included in the annual report. \"However, the ultimate return to satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the successful resolution of the related problems of credit quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial additional capital.\" First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid default. The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120 mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks. Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986, First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of 5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio. Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of 1986. First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs \"should be more modest.\" The amount represented 15 pct of First City's total loans. In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end. Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount could go higher. \"The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists,\" First City said. \"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of real estate-related chargeoffs.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the financial challenges faced by First City Bancorp of Texas, including their losses, the need for additional capital, and the issues with credit quality and funding, the most appropriate topic from the provided set is \"instal-debt.\" This topic pertains to financial matters related to debt obligations, credit, and potential restructuring efforts, which are central themes in the story.", "prediction": "instal-debt"}

Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\" Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said. \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS. Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.", "rationale": "The news story is clearly related to the topic of \"coffee,\" as it discusses the talks regarding global coffee export quotas, the International Coffee Organization (ICO), and the impact on coffee prices.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT. Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.", "rationale": "The news story is clearly about the oil market, discussing crude oil prices, OPEC's production quotas, and Saudi Arabia's efforts to maintain price levels.

Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said. They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks. G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit. Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987. The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said. The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today, with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close.

Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE. Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said. \"This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,\" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry. The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks. \"It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.

Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds. Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill).

{"label": "crude", "text": "OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT. Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here. The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.

Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. \"We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,\" Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. \"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,\" Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. \"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,\" he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although \"no hypothesis has been abandoned.\" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story should be \"coffee\" as the primary focus of the article is on Brazil's coffee exports, the breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, and the Brazilian Coffee Institute's (IBC) strategy in light of these events.

The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents. But the left-wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations. Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October. Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.

{"label": "trade", "text": "UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN. William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming \"one of the world's industrial lightweights.\" Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry. Bywater said, \"I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\"", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about a call for retaliation against Japan for their unfair practices in the semiconductor trade.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS. There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. \"There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet,\" he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" (or \"must sell\") levels without changing the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the \"lower indicative price\" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.

{"label": "trade", "text": "KEY U.S. HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL. The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws, chairman Dan Rostenkowski said. The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan. The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan. The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter. The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL. U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"crude.\" The story focuses on the rising prices of U.S. crude oil, the reduction in oil stocks, OPEC's production quotas, and the overall oil market dynamics.

A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE. Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, \"There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good.\" The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the \"lower indicative price,\" under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" or \"must sell\" levels, without changing the \"lower indicative price\" -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.", "rationale": "The news story is clearly focused on the negotiations surrounding the International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA).

The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft stockholders and members of Taft management about participating in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify any of the other people with whom it had talks. Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion dlr offer for the company. At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser, Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and to supply financial data to other interested bidders. \"If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them backing him on any deal,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. \"I think they wanted a way out.

A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall Street analysts said. Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger. The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate. There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested. Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes. One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker. Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile, analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going. \"I think the merger is not going through,\" said Phil Pace, analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger \"lost a lot of its appeal\" when the U.S. Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation. Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said \"30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\" \"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\" said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position, I don't know. \"It's getting a little confusing,\" said James Carroll, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger \"tend to be weak.\" Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22, the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer period of time. Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale. Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs. Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed \"the outlook for the industry has improved materially.\" Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.", "rationale": "The news story provided is primarily about the corporate actions related to a merger and a lawsuit, which are financial and business activities.

{"label": "grain", "text": "MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED, STUDY SAYS. More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a \"zero certificate case,\" where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled \"adequate certificate case\" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case. The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs. The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined. The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided set is: grain.

{"label": "acq", "text": "AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY. Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. \"It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,\" he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. \"They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it,\" Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,\" Hine said. \"It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,\" he added.", "rationale": "The news story provided is about Air Canada's acquisition of Gelco Corp's Canadian courier unit and the impact of this acquisition on the Canadian courier industry.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW TURNING INTO TRADE WAR. Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. Of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. Action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.", "rationale": "The news story is about a dispute between Japan and the U.S. over computer chips, which falls under the broader category of trade issues.

{"label": "acq", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS. More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore. \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity. \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\" A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on Japanese corporations acquiring overseas companies, particularly in the United States and Europe.

{"label": "crude", "text": "NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE. The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. \"This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, \"Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.\" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.", "rationale": "This news story is focused on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the expansion of trading hours for energy futures, specifically mentioning the trading of oil and platinum futures.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS. OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around OPEC, oil prices, production quotas, and the oil market, the appropriate topic to assign to this story is \"crude.\" The story discusses the potential need for OPEC to hold an emergency meeting to address the issue of oil supply and production in relation to maintaining or firming oil prices, which falls directly under the topic of crude oil.", "prediction": "tin"}

{"label": "acq", "text": "MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS. Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say. Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a rebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers. \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\" says Cole. \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars,\" he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, \"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares. \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says. \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public,\" said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international. \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says. \"It's not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which discusses the automobile dealership industry, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, and the size and scale of car dealerships, the most appropriate topic to assign from the given set would be \"acq\" for acquisitions.

Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said.

The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.

Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.", "rationale": "The topic that corresponds to the given news story is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the challenges and negotiations surrounding the restoration of coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Organization (ICO).

The Treasury proposed allowing temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last fall. The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next week requests written congressional and public comment within 60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries. The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry. \"The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the act,\" the Treasury brief said. The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including the Soviet Union for processing. Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export \"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\" The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the United States. \"The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made under bond,\" the brief said.

The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January, but major industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of production targets, official figures show. Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year. However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987. The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country's main export to Western nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from 97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983. Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6 billion in 1985. Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures. Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality controls imposed on enterprises. Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of the year compared with the same period of 1986.

The Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS. Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures.

Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.

Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use. \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here commented.", "rationale": "The news story is about reforms agreed upon by OECD countries regarding export credits, particularly those provided to developing countries.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES. This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range,\" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. \"If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the Bank of England's actions regarding interest rates and their impact on the British pound (sterling) in relation to market expectations and government policy.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER. New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story from the R52 dataset is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the trends and forecasts for coffee futures prices, market analysis by various analysts, and factors influencing the coffee market such as export quotas, producer stock levels, and demand.", "prediction": "coffee"}

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes, analysts and industry sources said. The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today. Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted. The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were. \"They are going to cut their estimate,\" said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. \"The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate.\" Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted. \"They'll temper it,\" said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. \"The main drop will probably come in July.\" She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story should be \"orange\" as it deals with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's estimate of the Florida orange crop.

U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said. \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. \"I am optimistic,\" he added.", "rationale": "The news story concerns a U.S.-Japan pact regarding microchip trade, which is a part of the broader semiconductor industry.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said.

However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the political implications of trade friction between Japan and the United States, with a focus on the impact on Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's political standing.

{"label": "acq", "text": "AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF. American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very profitable securities firm.\" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,\" said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. \"They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way,\" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.", "rationale": "The news story concerns American Express, a financial services company, and the possibility of it spinning off its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. division, as well as rumors about stock splitting and dividend increases.

{"label": "grain", "text": "ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET. The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\" \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\" According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out.", "rationale": "The news story provided is related to the agricultural sector, specifically focusing on the futures trading aspect of farm cooperatives.

Mellon Bank Corp said it expects to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share. The company also said it intends to reduce its second quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss reserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and increased provisions address four areas of concern in the bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector, developing countries, some basic industrial companies and several commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of total loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23 pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45 billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with 928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year, especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. \"This action relates both to loans to companies directly involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers, home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern United States,\" Barnes said. As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties, Barnes said. \"We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them aggressively,\" he added.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the financial performance and strategic decisions of Mellon Bank Corp, including its expected losses, loan-loss provisions, dividend reduction, and issues related to its lending portfolio in various sectors such as energy and real estate.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT. Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they're on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the differing opinions among U.S. economic officials regarding the reduction of the budget deficit, the effectiveness of tax policies, and economic growth projections.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN. The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a \"bear\" market. \"It's the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets. \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\" said O'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\" Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  \"We're still in a bull market,\" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The bear usually strikes slowly.\" Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit strangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on U.S. bank discount window borrowings, Federal Reserve statements, reserve projections, and banking system reserves, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"money-fx\" (money and foreign exchange).

Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said. \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some.

Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word.

{"label": "acq", "text": "NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND. Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"acq\" which stands for acquisitions.

OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. \"We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which centers around OPEC's commitment to fixed crude oil prices and overall output ceiling, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story from the provided set is \"crude.\"", "prediction": "crude"}

Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said. They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed. Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25. The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform. Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable. The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said. Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said. Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.

The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October. Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986. It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports. Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added. Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT. Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week. Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date.", "rationale": "The news story is about Malaysia's consideration of whether to join the International Cocoa Agreement and the implications for local cocoa producers and traders.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS. Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. \"We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,\" he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

{"label": "acq", "text": "ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS. Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a \"dominant\" holding, an Italian government committee ruled. The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings, headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision reflected the \"need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.\" It did not quantify what might constitute a \"dominant\" holding. The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly. Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest. The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits. These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which discusses regulations concerning company holdings in banks, the allocation of credits, and supervision by the Bank of Italy, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"banking.\" However, \"banking\" is not among the listed topics.

{"label": "copper", "text": "ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA. Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said. The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\" According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat said. \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,\" he added.", "rationale": "The topic for the provided news story is \"copper.\" The story discusses Zambia's decision to stop sending its copper exports through South Africa and the implications for Zambia's economy and trade routes.", "prediction": "copper"}

{"label": "earn", "text": "IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST. International Business Machines Corp, hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said. \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not until later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm. Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending. IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs. Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company itself, have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM's growth. But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view. \"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said of DEC's line of VAX computers. In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said. Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business.\" He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988. High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said. By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs. Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area. In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than stealing market share from one another.", "rationale": "The news story is about the anticipated rebound in earnings for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), with a focus on their mid-range computer products and the overall financial performance of the company.

{"label": "retail", "text": "U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS. U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\"", "rationale": "The news story focuses on U.S. retail sales, discussing the fluctuations in consumer spending, trends in the economy, and how these factors may influence monetary policy.

{"label": "retail", "text": "FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN. U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively.

The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. \"Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that.", "rationale": "The news story describes a strike by Brazilian seamen, the involvement of the government, and the impact of the strike on the country's trade and economic situation.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "BAHIA COCOA REVIEW. Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.

Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.

Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000.

{"label": "earn", "text": "DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN. Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses, the company said. \"The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years,\" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. \"But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,\" chairman Macdonald said. \"It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment, and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence,\" he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30, under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs, which are used in the new accounting calculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity.

Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\" He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders.

Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further. \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market. \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>. Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers. The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong. Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices. \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,\" he said. The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said. He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales.

The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING. U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said. \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\" Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen since the start of the year,\" Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\" Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY. There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said. Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move. The sources today said the government's policy remained one of \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.

Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE. French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America's oldest ally in war and peace.\" \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington. The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers' OPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration's desire to lessen government intervention in trade.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story discusses arms control and trade issues between French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and President Ronald Reagan, with a specific focus on trade disputes and concerns over protectionism.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) and its provisions regarding the rubber market, including the use of a buffer stock for market intervention, reference prices, and conditions for buying and selling to stabilize prices.

{"label": "earn", "text": "CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET. Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\" A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\" Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's financial performance, including profit forecasts, dividends, fuel prices, currency exchange factors, and passenger yield, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"earn\" (earnings).

But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group said it expected satisfactory business development over the next months. \"At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary influences such as there were last year,\" it said. Orders in hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level. BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985. The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said. The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In the parent company, the positive earnings development continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to 1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in raw materials. In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47 billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell 8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.

Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news. Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit. \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,\" said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. \"The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments,\" Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said. \"The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country,\" one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions.

Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.

First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,\" Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies. \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\" Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations \"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. \"The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we don't think the international markets are well-served.\" Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had to be there.\" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.\" Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. \"That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,\" said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.\" He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.", "rationale": "The news story is about Royal Trustco Ltd's strategy for global expansion and its plans for increasing the foreign share of its yearly earnings.

The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not a factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around a merger proposal between Hughes Tool Co and Baker International Corp, which are companies involved in oil field services.

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY. The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\" The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit.", "rationale": "The news story describes the decisions and discussions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding the monetary policy of the United States.

The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).

On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln.

Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.

Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. \"There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.

{"label": "ship", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY. Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the challenges and recovery plans of Japan's shipbuilding industry.

Profit from its second largest geographical area, North America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar. Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.

Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. \"China is short of foreign exchange,\" the Shanghai official said. \"We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer.\" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,\" the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,\" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,\" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said.", "rationale": "Based on the content and focus of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"grain.\" The story primarily discusses China's grain imports, the impact of drought on grain harvests, domestic demand for grain, and policies related to grain production and pricing.

Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more.

Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said.

American Eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists. World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said. Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia. She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity. The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the open market, Pope said. Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's West German market share at 60 pct. The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here.

{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS. A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products. Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws.", "rationale": "The news story deals with the easing of export controls, changes in trade laws, and measures related to foreign takeovers of U.S. companies and retaliation against unfair foreign trade practices.

{"label": "reserves", "text": "FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY. French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS). Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said. This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments. The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc. On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency. The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December. Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.

Canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.", "rationale": "The news story provided is about the Canadian federal government announcing an aid package for the oil industry.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME. Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island's newly launched treasury bill programme. The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them. The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\" Under the current system, the agency provides the island's 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds. \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states. The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge. The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days. Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme. Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank. Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly. Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct. Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the topic that should be assigned to this story is \"money-fx\" as it discusses the introduction of a new domestic money market regime in Bahrain, changes to dinar liquidity aid, and the use of treasury bills and repurchase agreements, all of which are related to foreign exchange and money market operations.", "prediction": "money-fx"}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED. Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating. \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the oil industry and the proposed tax breaks to stimulate activity within that industry.

The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86. The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year. The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year.

Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.

The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT. European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European Community finance ministers and central bankers meeting to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float (the European Monetary System - EMS) and addressing issues related to currency market turbulence, exchange rates, and monetary integration.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION. Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the oil industry in California, specifically the drilling activity, oil production levels, and the impact of oil prices on these activities.

The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,\" Ebinger said. He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting. \"Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests,\" Ebinger said. Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring. But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring. There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June. He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production. OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said. OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale.", "rationale": "The news story is related to the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export pricing system for coffee.

Southern Co said it will take an after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers in Georgia will be asked to pay. The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric rates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September 1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a full-power license. The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was due to several factors, including additional labor costs incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would \"cap\" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected 8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is 313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts with the joint owners require the utility to buy back significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase that applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged against earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is specifically discussing the cocoa crop and its potential yield due to weather conditions and disease.

He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.. Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by \"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the failure of talks regarding the re-establishment of International Coffee Organization (ICO) quotas, the United States' position on setting these quotas based on objective criteria, and the political and market implications of this situation.

Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"tin,\" as the article discusses measures taken by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to curb tin exports with the aim of reducing the world surplus and boosting tin prices.

Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. \"The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week,\" Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said.

Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.

Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work,\" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around a series of takeover bids and merger talks in the airline industry, particularly focusing on Carl Icahn's bid for USAir Group and the potential implications for the takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc.

The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners. \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement. \"I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,\" he added.

{"label": "crude", "text": "KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS. Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure.

Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a \"memorandum of understanding\" on cargo preference.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>. Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. \"They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth,\" said one arbitrager, who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. \"It makes sense,\" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But \"It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a 100 pct of the synergies.\" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. \"This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,\" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer, but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary, speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr \"bridge\" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan.

Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues.", "rationale": "The news story you provided pertains to a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by Emery Air Freight Corp, with mentions of stock values, takeover bids, analysts' expectations, corporate acquisitions, and market share within the package delivery industry.

{"label": "trade", "text": "SOUTH KOREA TO MAINTAIN TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS. South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said \"yes, I think so.\" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said \"I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.\" But he added \"the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons.\" Speaking of his own country, he said \"We have made a lot of concessions already.\" He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said \"at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.\" South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives and discussions around protectionist measures and free trade, the topic assigned to this news story is \"trade.\"", "prediction": "trade"}

The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2 pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September. In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7 pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct.

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY. European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.

OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\" It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices.

{"label": "trade", "text": "UK MAY REVOKE JAPANESE FINANCIAL LICENSES. The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources said. \"We can't say \"yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)\" but this is definitely being considered,\" an official said. His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan. Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. \"There's a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan,\" another government official told Reuters. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access. She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said. The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show. A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to \"coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences\" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called \"restrictive conditions\" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market. The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action. Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament. 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said. The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements. \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance,\" one official said. \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times,\" the official added. Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said. British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan. \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" he said, adding \"(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.\" Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade \"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\" The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said. But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate. Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange. In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.", "rationale": "The news story provided revolves around the tensions between the United Kingdom and Japan regarding market access and trade practices.

{"label": "tin", "text": "TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED. Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.

Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38. President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\"", "rationale": "The news story provided is related to the airline industry, focusing on the financial performance of Swissair, including its net profit, dividend policy, and factors influencing its business such as fuel prices and exchange rates.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.
