{"label": "gnp", "text": "ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD. The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.

Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs. He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of 417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product. Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the target by 22.5 billion francs. Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion. The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations. Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz. Last year, the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs. The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a \"snowball effect\" under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT. European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European Community finance ministers and central bankers meeting to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float (the European Monetary System - EMS) and addressing issues related to currency market turbulence, exchange rates, and monetary integration.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING. U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said. \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\" Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen since the start of the year,\" Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\" Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"money-fx\" as it discusses issues related to the financial markets in the Gulf region, including money markets, stock markets, and bond markets.

Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\" He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments.\" Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports. Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said, \"You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris.\" The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct. West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany's exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany's economic growth this year. The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct. Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which centers around West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's comments on currency agreements, economic policy, trade balances, and the Paris currency accord, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"money-fx\" (money and foreign exchange).

{"label": "rubber", "text": "LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER. A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus \"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,\" one official said. \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about a leaf disease affecting rubber plantations in Sri Lanka, which may lead to a reduction in rubber output and impact rubber prices.

{"label": "jobs", "text": "FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT. The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation. The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program. Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show. The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market. Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the French government's plans to combat long-term unemployment and stimulate the economy.

At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European sugar beet plantings and their implications for sugar production and market dynamics.

The April figure is expected to be revised upwards by approximately 0.8 percentage points next month when the May data is released, a statement from the Ministry said. The IPI stood at a provisional 105.6 in April, compared to 101.1 in March and 102.3 in February. The Ministry had previously estimated the March and February indices at 101.9 and 102.5 respectively. In April 1986, the output index was at 101.1, resulting in a year-on-year increase for April 1987 of 4.5 pct.

The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.

{"label": "tin", "text": "TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED. Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin \"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.

Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report. The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986.

Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.

An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures.

Canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.

British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4.

Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.

Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is \"crude,\" as the article discusses the recovery of Canada's oil industry, which is directly related to crude oil prices, the performance of oil companies, and the impact of government aid on the industry.", "prediction": "crude"}

French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America's oldest ally in war and peace.\" \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied.

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT. Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further. \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market. \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>. Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers. The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong. Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices. \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,\" he said. The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said. He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.", "rationale": "The news story is about Japan's efforts to comply with a bilateral agreement with the United States regarding the sale and production of computer micro-chips, specifically addressing concerns about selling chips below market price and importing American semiconductors.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS. Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\" \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\" He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most relevant topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story discusses the impact of U.S. sanctions on Poland's economy, the loss of Most Favoured Nation trading status, the subsequent effect on Polish exports and imports, and the broader implications for trade relations.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said. However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the political implications of trade friction between Japan and the United States, with a focus on the impact on Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's political standing.

The official said both surplus countries, like West Germany and Japan, and deficit countries, like the U.S., agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth. He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S. competitiveness.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives and discussions around protectionist measures and free trade, the topic assigned to this news story is \"trade.\"", "prediction": "trade"}

{"label": "grain", "text": "CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION. Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said.

New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story from the R52 dataset is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the trends and forecasts for coffee futures prices, market analysis by various analysts, and factors influencing the coffee market such as export quotas, producer stock levels, and demand.", "prediction": "coffee"}

However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale.", "rationale": "The news story is related to the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export pricing system for coffee.

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED. Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating. \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE. Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.", "rationale": "The topic that best fits the news story provided is \"coffee.\" The story centers around the issues faced by Indonesian coffee exporters, the negotiations over export quotas within the International Coffee Organization, and the positions of various countries on the quota system.", "prediction": "coffee"}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS. Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER. New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story from the R52 dataset is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the trends and forecasts for coffee futures prices, market analysis by various analysts, and factors influencing the coffee market such as export quotas, producer stock levels, and demand.", "prediction": "coffee"}

Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\"", "rationale": "The news story focuses on U.S. retail sales, discussing the fluctuations in consumer spending, trends in the economy, and how these factors may influence monetary policy.
