{"label": "earn", "text": "WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC>. Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday, traders and analysts said. The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987, ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago. That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company earned 70 cts a share. Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2. At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 \"are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low.\" Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year. Crossen said \"because Marion is still just a small company, the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line.\" He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share. \"The company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most innovative company in the business,\" he said. For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY. Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: \"We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\" He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets."}

Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment. Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, Nomura said.

{"label": "ipi", "text": "REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC. The Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said. The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as computers and microprocessors."}

The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is 24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.

Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986 was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an increase in bad debt reserves. Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986. Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which were not adequate at the time of acquisition. He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second and fourth quarters.

At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States.

Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores."}

Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off."}

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment.

U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market.\" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. \"The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,\" he told Reuters. Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY. Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\" Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\" \"The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy,\" said First Chicago's Johnson. \"Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.\""}

Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism.

And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure.

The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep.

Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan. The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan. The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter. The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE. French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America's oldest ally in war and peace.\" \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington. The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers' OPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration's desire to lessen government intervention in trade."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE. The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices,\" a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the \"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers.\" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said."}

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said.

Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month.

The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said. The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats.

Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week. \"We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,\" Levitt said. Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said. However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.

The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive."}

Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said. Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs."}

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.\""}

Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS. One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business."}

The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.

Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news. Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit. \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,\" said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee. \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\" The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program. The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded.

The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS. Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said \"It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. \"The demand wasn't so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said."}

Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended its oil supply contracts, Cote said: \"It's not a question of cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point.\" On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system, regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a trial basis to the end of 1987. Under the new system, producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts. Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners. \"We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has been finalized,\" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said. Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast demand for its refineries, Strong said. \"We have to know what they have and how that relates to what we need in total,\" he said. Strong said figures on the amount of crude production Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately available."}

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade). He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies. Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct. Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits. Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange. Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern state of  arequipa. Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies.

In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks, Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain to the public. The company will register a proposed offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters. \"Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,\" Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company would use much of the income from the amusement park chain, were it to be sold, to repay debt. Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at 350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said. Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six Flags by several prospective buyers. The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln dlrs mountain of debt. Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget Inc &lt;GNG.N>.

By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they're on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said."}

The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February. The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline. The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a decline last June of 75,000, the department said. Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct level in March, 1986. Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in recent months, with the gains concentrated in service industries. The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March, while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in March. Business and health services showed the largest gains in jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000. The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0 hours in February, the department said. Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6. The department's survey of households showed the number of unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln. The number of persons working part time for economic reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February. The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19 mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal adjustment, the department said. Mining employment was little changed in March and has not experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986. Other service industries that increased jobs last month were finance, insurance, and real estate."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW. Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.\" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. \"It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, \"We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\" They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets, government officials said."}

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS. Canada may begin monitoring steel flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is being illegally \"trans-shipped\" to the U.S., senior government trade officials said. The officials, asking not to be identified, said the government will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about the level of Canadian exports south of the border. But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified, said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S. \"In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,\" said one official who claimed Canadian companies were \"fair traders\" in the big American market. If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or four months. \"I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would have to do something about it,\" said a trade official. Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago. The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel producers. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the American market be limited to 2.4 per cent. The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country. Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw steel, which makes up less than half the steel market. Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in 1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the same year."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE. Time Inc's chief financial officer, Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is \"comfortable\" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share. In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share, including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced.  On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time. In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest acquisition ever. N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said the company might be interested in a relatively small book business. He said following the recent agreement for the sale of Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, \"there may be pieces that Murdoch doesn't want,\" referring to News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch. Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro said it is a \"delicate subject\", and \"we're looking at all the options.\" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as much as 500 mln dlrs.  Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a special gain in the HBO unit. Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber growth of 800,000 for last year. He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points. Munro said the company does not plan to increase its dividend. Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at getting involved in the home shopping video area. \"It would be foolish not to be a player there,\" he said. He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year, but nothing came of the talks."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. SENATE TRADE LEADER CONCERNED ABOUT CANADA. The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week. The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners. \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement. \"I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,\" he added. Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval. \"I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,\" Bentsen said. Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in Ottawa. Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS. U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here. \"If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc \"If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,\" he added. Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20. The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the API said. Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp &lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings. \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France. Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said. Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,\" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED. The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. \"I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. \"I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday's employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE. Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said."}

Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z>, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

{"label": "trade", "text": "EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS. The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said. Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session: \"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.\" Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: \"We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.\" A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work. Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon. Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: \"We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions.\" Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: \"This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.\" West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement. The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January. The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC."}

Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said. \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said. Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don't.\" \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry. \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think,\" Holden-Brown said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\" \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters. Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word.

Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said. However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market."}

It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.

But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports."}

Bally Manufacturing Corp said it expects a charge to earnings in the first quarter of this year of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chicago-based hotel, casino, gambling and amusement concern also said the anticipated charge against first quarter earnings will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes. Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy 2.6 mln of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4 mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of Bally. The agreement also calls for Bally to pay Trump another 6.2 mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said. Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to seek control of the company for 10 years, it said. Bear, Stearns and Co Inc signed a similar standstill agreement with Bally for three years, Bally said. But it can still deal in Bally stock as a broker, it said.

Japan's overall wholesale price index (base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to 86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bank of Japan said. Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December. The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said. The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices, it said. On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January. The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8 pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up 16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said. The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier. The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to 57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier. The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February, its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added to the decline. The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier. The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system. Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected, the bank said."}

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by \"a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.\" U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\" He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\" \"We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA. World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87."}

{"label": "ipi", "text": "SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS. The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January, but major industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of production targets, official figures show. Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year. However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987. The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country's main export to Western nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from 97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983. Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6 billion in 1985. Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures. Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality controls imposed on enterprises. Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of the year compared with the same period of 1986. The figures showed that five republics produced less than in the first two months of 1986."}

The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said.

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson told financial analysts. \"Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new product each year,\" Henderson said. He also said research and development spending in this business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.

Sales in the United States totaled about three billion dlrs, ICI executives said. In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will come from ICI's research and development activities, but the company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition program.

Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year's revenues. This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides. He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future. Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY. Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. \"It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,\" he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. \"They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it,\" Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,\" Hine said. \"It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,\" he added."}

Employers in Rotterdam port's strike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers' organisation spokesman said. An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal fault in the employers' redundancy procedure. The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling. Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was resolved. Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's 4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this year. The employers said there were no immediate plans for meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or on a new work practice agreement in the sector. Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the port's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated, although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector, the employers' spokesman added."}

A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.

Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986. President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress. \"I think it's about time,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, \"It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing.\" Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts. Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products. Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987. \"It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we're serious,\" Smart said of the White House trade sanctions. The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers. \"All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be,\" he said. Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said."}

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.

Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.\" \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\" Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business."}

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.

Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers."}

The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.

The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\" Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks."}

Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today. He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action. Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses. Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs. The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries. \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt,\" he said."}

The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers."}

The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters. \"The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive,\" Monsod said an interview. \"No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.\" The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. \"If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,\" she said. \"But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.\" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. \"I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.\" Monsod said, \"The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.\" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING. Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\" Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said."}

K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985, it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, \"a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations.\" K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.

Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first quarter report.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT. The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. \"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,\" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day."}

Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said. He added: \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000.\" The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last Sepember. The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in June. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

Philippine government revenue is expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from 79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said. In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details. He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. \"In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct,\" he said. Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February. He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform. Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors. The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION. Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30."}

He told reporters:\"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio.\" He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of \"a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs.\" \"At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year,\" he said, \"though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. \"Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better,\" he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. \"But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,\" he said."}

The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\" Hair called the department's proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's annual report says. One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be restored to current earnings status, it said. As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change \"in its entirety\" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules, and although the impact will not be material in the short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report said. The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said. Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in 1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it said. Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place, the report said. This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.

MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at 725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own. \"I think the offer is too low by at least five points,\" said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of \"one of the finest casinos in the world.\" Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares. Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8. A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may issue a public statement after it has studied the offer. Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two dlrs per share.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES. Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,\" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino. \"I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.\" \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA's bid to control production. \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production. He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry. \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said. \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling. \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar,\" he said. Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984. \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said. \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\" He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound. \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,\" he said. Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production. He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup. \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.\" Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986. Yulo said despite next year's increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down. \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season.\""}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>. Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer, either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin) Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want to remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle, Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no steps toward a transaction. \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate battles I've seen,\" said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited from that company's restructuring. \"Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per share,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is seeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction. Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however, believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8. \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's current holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business, which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman. Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office equipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\" Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo security guards. It also has an information services business, and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986, earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs. GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union Carbide shares."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT. Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week. Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE. A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today. \"Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,\" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention. Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level. Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so. Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date. The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.

The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN. Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said. The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane. Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said. The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December. He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane. But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said. \"It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls,\" he said."}

Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues. Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm. Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone's visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5. Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, \"I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended.\" Nakasone did not elaborate. The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact. Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said."}

Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month. The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results. A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries. Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May. One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said. \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography,\" the source said. He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world. \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.

{"label": "acq", "text": "SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES. The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL. U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "JAPANESE GROUPS URGE DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE. Japan's leading economic organisations urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned tax reforms, officials involved said. Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy. Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy. Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy. The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates. Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct. Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990. The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET. Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\" A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\" Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said."}

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the \"may-buy\" level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.

The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today. Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted. The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were. \"They are going to cut their estimate,\" said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. \"The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate.\" Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted. \"They'll temper it,\" said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. \"The main drop will probably come in July.\" She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES. Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to &lt;American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.

The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said.

{"label": "earn", "text": "DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN. Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses, the company said. \"The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years,\" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. \"But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,\" chairman Macdonald said. \"It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment, and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence,\" he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30, under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs, which are used in the new accounting calculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day from 591.0 mcf a day."}

The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: \"Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.\""}

However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks.

Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said.

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry."}

The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base. Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close."}

The value of China's industrial output in January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said. Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January 1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986. The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. \"No significant improvement was made in economic results,\" it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986. The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986. It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country. It gave no more details. The official industrial growth target this year is seven pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS. Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query. The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said."}

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES. European Community (EC) industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion, but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes, provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products, typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system, which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer proportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw, insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account. The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL. Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company. However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover. \"There are too many uncertainties,\" said one arbitrager. Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4. Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share. The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company. \"Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites. Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co, its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring. Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft, which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50 years ago, has about 12 pct. Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft. \"I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager, but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s. Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout. \"Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved,\" he said, adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft. He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry."}

In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range. In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985. In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26 dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs. Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits. By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow. In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes. Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which expenditures were held below budget."}

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit strangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks."}

It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale, which introduced a new menu. Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill - hurt results. It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items, rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads and baking products major contributors to improvement in the quarter. A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said. Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early retirement program initiated a year ago.

{"label": "alum", "text": "NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE. The London Metal Exchange's, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract. This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS. OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT. Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement. \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said. Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers. \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future. \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS. Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash."}

He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade. He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT. Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services. De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand. Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible.

{"label": "tea", "text": "PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS. Pakistan's decision to suspend tea import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi broking houses and exporters said. Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports. The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports. The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the trade imbalance for some time. \"We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ... (it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market,\" a source at one broking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday. \"The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,\" he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan, Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major markets for its tea, the sources added. Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer to find new outlets, they said."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT. A new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today. The new accord is due to replace the current one, which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented \"a historic moment.\" The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we often faced problems.\" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended, but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto added. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.\" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers, said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.\" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers, agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement \"attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry.\""}

The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers and directors \"concerning participation in a group to acquire control\" of the company. The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft stockholders and members of Taft management about participating in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify any of the other people with whom it had talks. Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion dlr offer for the company. At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser, Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and to supply financial data to other interested bidders. \"If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them backing him on any deal,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. \"I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,\" said Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.

Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2 pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment. Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values for the company.

He said this revision, which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions, takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade.

Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms.

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22. The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires. Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said. The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks. However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity. The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred. Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.

The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result \"of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.\" The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\" \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said. \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,\" the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled \"because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December. Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea Containers' business.

He cited the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers, costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs. He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs."}

Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said. They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed. Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25. The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform. Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable. The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said. Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said. Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said. They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS. The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight rates. The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion pesetas. A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing money supply figures for February. The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth was 11.4 pct last year. The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds. \"The policy is proving counter-productive and rates will have to come down in the long-term,\" the bank spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries. He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad. \"At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other countries with much lower rates,\" he said."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER. Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit, Wall Street analysts said. \"I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works,\" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with L.F. Rothschild. \"There are unquestionably other buyers out there,\" added Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. \"A lot of companies have looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.\" Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif., and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts said. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>, Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust problems, the analysts added. Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino, Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by Fairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs, because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned companies. \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U.S. government didn't want it,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government's apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems. \"The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. \"That, I think, is the real significance of this.\" Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said. However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM. Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production. \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalance and tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, \"differentiated policy treatment is required\" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said. \"Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,\" he said."}

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said \"significant progress\" was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging. Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons, Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries. Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, \"a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.\" In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost. \"Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades, we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising, one that is under-developed and under-employed,\" said Mulroney. \"What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity.\" Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners. Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes, something that would give Canada protection from Washington's tough trade remedy laws. But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a \"fair trader\" and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market. He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides. \"We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is fair to both sides,\" Mulroney said."}

The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.

{"label": "acq", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS. More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore. \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity. \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\" A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves."}

But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\" Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC. Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY. The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\" The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit."}

Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March.

A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\" Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring.\" He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce \"reasonable stability\" in exchange markets over the next few months. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to give time for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was affected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market. Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, \"I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and Japan's) efforts can be carried out. Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar. Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade deficit. Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable."}
{"label": "money-supply", "text": "N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH. Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said. The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement. The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said. Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year. \"Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market,\" Russell said."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD. Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>. General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.\" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM,\" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important.\""}

Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend. The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms. Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines on grants. He added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry. Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post Office. The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany, especially as far as deciding who is able to provide telecommunications equipment."}

{"label": "gold", "text": "\"BRITANNIA\" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM. The new British one ounce gold coin, the \"Britannia,\" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a \"competitive premium,\" Treasury officials said. Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins. Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold. Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases. No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price. There were some enquiries on the \"Britannia\" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said. Some said that the \"Britannia\" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established."}
{"label": "acq", "text": "MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS. Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say. Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a rebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers. \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\" says Cole. \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars,\" he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, \"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares. \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says. \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public,\" said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international. \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says. \"It's not totally off the wall,\" says Cole."}

The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT. In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods. The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules. The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>, whose \"aramid\" synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violate the American company's patents. Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions. The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court. \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States,\" it said in a statement."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS. China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988.

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.. China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.\" The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said. \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,\" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM. The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE. The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that's Baker's strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure."}

The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods. The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said. \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said. The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year. But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products. It extends until January 1993, the administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods."}
{"label": "sugar", "text": "RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING. The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added."}

The Ferruzzi Group's holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION. Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. \"Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY. Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said."}

Chemicals group Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985."}

In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries. \"I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,\" Howard told reporters. \"He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home,\" he added. British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said. Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan. \"I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations,\" Howard said. \"We simply aren't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time.\" Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister. But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade. Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied. Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue. \"There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,\" he added, but gave no details. He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with. \"But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time,\" he added. \"What I've made plain is we expect to see action.\" Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR. The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters. They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised. \"The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock,\" a senior official said. He said the government has finalised an agreement with E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department. Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks. The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said. Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. The Department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes. An Importers Association official said that \"even if the Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more.\" This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said. The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting April 1. Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For the past two years."}

The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION. Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\" He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN. The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "YEUTTER SEES U.S., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT. The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. \"Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.\" He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. \"That's a very healthy development,\" he added.\"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.\" \"Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,\" Yeutter said. \"They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.\" He added, \"Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.\""}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS. A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products. Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL. Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,\" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said. They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.\" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. \"It is purely coincidence,\" he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. \"Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family,\" said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET. The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\" \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\" According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out."}

A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of Transportation, and later today it will file a response to USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.

However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened. Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending."}

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.

{"label": "cotton", "text": "ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES. U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said."}

However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product. Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear. \"As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity,\" Sims said in a telephone interview.

King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.\" Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,\" he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said."}

Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. \"We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems\" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said \"Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals.\" Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. \"Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel,\" Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD. The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending. Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax."}

Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.

American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage."}

Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said. \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said. \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility.\""}

Madagascar's available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said. This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside, they said. The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985. Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said. They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes were planted before 1930. The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's 1986-1990 five-year plan. In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said. The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content. The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year."}

Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show.

According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.

{"label": "acq", "text": "NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND. Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said."}

Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining.

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive. \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\" Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable touch of the budget.\" Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said. Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday's 375p. REUTER..."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES. The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said. The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct. An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly. New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc &lt;PBI> said \"the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.\" Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter. Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct. The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant. The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies."}

However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection. \"To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,\" he said.

Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, Annesley said \"Encor is a strategic investment for Dome, and we have no intention of selling it.\" Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares. He also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares. \"Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of Dome Mines stock) are very attractive,\" Annesley commented. \"We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,\" he added.

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said. The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October. Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986. It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports. Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added. Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports. It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985. \"In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances on current account will be bridged over the near term,\" Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report. The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year. The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE. State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus Industrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt and Whitney unit."}

He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits. Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes. \"The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take,\" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency. On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure. Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries. The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations' \"investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt there.\" Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said \"I think you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year.\""}

For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs. Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security Administration. The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government officials and defaud the Social Security Administration. Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.  Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement. The charges would then be dropped if the defendants successfully complete the probation period. Details of the requirements in the agreement were not immediately available."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR. Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\" He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms."}

Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. \"An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community,\" Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, \"otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.\" Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. \"Something must give soon.

Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. \"It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share,\" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. \"I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts,\" Beall said, adding, \"long-term, we have a very serious problem.\" In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S."}

Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices. Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports. Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said. The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985. Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year. However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices. Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices. He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions."}

The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.

UAL stock today was up three at 63 in active trading. \"They (ferris and Trump) talked last week. Apparently, Trump said he was interested in it as an investment. He didn't say how much stock he had.

The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement. In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement. The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required. \"America's interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments,\" the trade group said. The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday. The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers."}

{"label": "retail", "text": "U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS. U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\""}

{"label": "retail", "text": "FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN. U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\" said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber. Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. \"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales,\" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan. Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period. Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest. Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago. \"February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half.

Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency. But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. \"We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed,\" he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits.

A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress. At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations. The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy. Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds. Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.\" \"I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill,\" he added. Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition.

One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term. Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday. Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue. One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar. The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture. Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992. Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said.

Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said. Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network. \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is also chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>.

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets."}
{"label": "earn", "text": "CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER. Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley. \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's,\" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western."}

Preliminary talks are on between two state-owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC) which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said. G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect. \"It is the other way round,\" Valentchits said. He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, had approached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year. \"We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project,\" Valentchits said. He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were \"only just initial.\" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment. Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation. The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure. Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the lead agent. The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed by Citicorp. It said the government's privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm. The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors. The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos. NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties. The firm produced 1,863 tonnes of nickel in the first two months of 1986, compared with 2,364 tonnes in the same period in 1985. The mine's capacity is 2,000 tonnes a month."}

{"label": "alum", "text": "KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES. Owners of two aluminum smelters in Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky. But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd &lt;AL>, said further viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the rate case is eventually settled. \"We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for sure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter,\" a National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other variables to consider in any decision whether to close or continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles west of Louisville. National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc &lt;NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which holds the rest, the spokesman said. A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, \"The decision is 48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a long time before we can make a decision\" about what it means for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of Louisville. \"But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was denied the requested rate increase.\" A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates. The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which include Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility spokesman said. The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said. \"We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable,\" he said. No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for July 28."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION. Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION. Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said. Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT. The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said. SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points, with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse. The government's banking adviser for the operation was &lt;Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere>, BPGF, owned by French financier Pierre Moussa's &lt;Pallas> group, assisted by Britain's &lt;Hambros Bank Ltd>."}

{"label": "interest", "text": "JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES. Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL. The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners. The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.\" Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.\" Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.\" Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms. \"Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,\" he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan. There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS. German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added."}

He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\" He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.

The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not a factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies."}

{"label": "crude", "text": "KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS. Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve."}

Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.

{"label": "alum", "text": "ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT. Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil. Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes."}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX. The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "EXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER. &lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs. Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion. It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day. The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis."}
{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING. A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday. Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level."}

Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured. Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked. \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said. \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said. \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,\" he added. The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected. Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states. Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons. Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation."}

Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux &lt;LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference. Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added. Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said. In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee &lt;CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said. Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said. He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years. Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France. Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said. Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market. Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year. Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln."}

Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's \"B\" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings."}

{"label": "grain", "text": "CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987. China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. \"China is short of foreign exchange,\" the Shanghai official said. \"We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer.\" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,\" the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,\" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,\" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said."}
{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA. Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. \"All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN. Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time. She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way. \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said. However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987. Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase. \"We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger,\" Love said, referring to Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical. The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points, Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas' struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6 mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln dlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. \"I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,\" he said. \"The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans.\" In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct. More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans, which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln dlrs the year before, were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four years, he said. \"I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel,\" he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business, Love said. \"We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,\" he said. In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area, and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks, he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>, both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. \"We think we can try to get a little part of their roost,\" he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products, he said. \"We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,\" he said, referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking."}

Galactic Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs. As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984. Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said. Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results. The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said. Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments. Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings. The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces. Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000 ounces."}

Callebaut told Reuters that Amylum, a leading starch and isoglucose manufacturer in which Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc &lt;TATL.L> holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosed initial takeover offer for CPC's European corn wet milling business by the close of CPC's tender on March 17. The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi's 630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said. On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr deal. Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of shares in its unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> to fund the CPC takeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid. \"For the time being we just await developments.

Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems. Producers and consumers indicated support \"in principle\" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said. Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said. Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said. Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said. Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added."}

Tandem Computers Inc said it expects higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter ending March 31 against a year ago. \"We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the quarter,\" James Treybig, president and and chief executive officer, told a meeting of securities analysts. In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned 9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln dlrs. Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is traditionally slower than the first. L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per share.

{"label": "crude", "text": "BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES. British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs."}

Profit from its second largest geographical area, North America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar. Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year. Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a 16.5 mln debit previously.

Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said. Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging. The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said. Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets."}

{"label": "reserves", "text": "MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS. Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring."}

The dollar's tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22. Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's tumble, securities house dealers said. They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said. The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said. They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said. A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market. The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said. Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986, Finance Ministry sources said. The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers said. Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said. \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian dollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at &lt;Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd> said."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT. CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs. The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore production in Australia, they said. Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the Cooper-Eromanga area. \"These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass Strait production now under way,\" McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date, will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss, he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS. Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a \"dominant\" holding, an Italian government committee ruled. The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings, headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision reflected the \"need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.\" It did not quantify what might constitute a \"dominant\" holding. The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly. Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest. The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits. These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank."}

Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.

The main measure of U.K. Broad money, sterling M3, grew a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2-1/4 pct in February after a rise of 1.1 pct in January, the Bank of England said. The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19 pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in January. Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion. Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4 billion rise in January, the Bank said. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in January. Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said. Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by 300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January. On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2 pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January. The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March 30. The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg. Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg, the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was therefore about flat, the Bank said.

World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp &lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability. \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added."}

Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying. \"The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know which way to go,\" one analyst said. Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS. Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. \"There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared."}
{"label": "gnp", "text": "FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH. French gross domestic product will grow by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said. However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct. IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand, unleashing higher import demand. Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298 mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of French debts. Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs. French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct in 1988, it added. Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986. Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986, is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct. However, the institute said inflation would fall back to 2.5 pct at the end of 1988, \"provided that real wage costs remain within the framework of productivity rises.\""}

Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire. A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities."}

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said."}

Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said \"We are gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying the export charge on lumber.\" He added the agreement was important to the health of the U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully carried out."}

{"label": "jobs", "text": "JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT. Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used,\" one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said."}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE. Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added. Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said. Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later. Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August."}

{"label": "bop", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP. China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China,\" he said. \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\" Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. \"We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing."}

Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies. But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG &lt;SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES. House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill."}

Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. \"There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking,\" a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. \"The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.\" \"If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month,\" Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year.

Bolivia's top union leader today joined a hunger strike by 1,300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said. Juan Lechin Oquendo, the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization, COB, told reporters: \"I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike\". Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro. The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay. About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia's minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said. \"I will take part in the miners' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast,\" Lechin told reporters. The COMIBOL miners' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry. About 20,000 miners, or two-thirds of the working force, have been laid off through the government's decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price. The government, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has called the miners' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who began a four-day visit last Friday. \"I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike,\" Lechin told reporters. \"I also have to orga- nise the strike.\" Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez, the miners' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast, union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner."}

WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending. The statement said WestLB International's business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year. This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based. Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of 1.1 billion. WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of services for private clients."}

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY. West Germany's money supply growth slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply, short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January. In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January. Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct. In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash and sight deposits, rose seven pct. International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said. Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise. But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said. Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February. A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities. At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level. The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said. Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank. Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January. A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month."}

U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said. \"People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. \"We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates,\" Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for \"less than ebullient market action,\" Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range. \"My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified,\" Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. \"All of the movement occurs at the opening,\" afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were \"not real exciting,\" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. \"There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment,\" Leiner said. Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979. \"The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal,\" Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said."}

Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986."}

{"label": "acq", "text": "U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS. The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law. The industry trade association called on U.S. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees. The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers. But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate. The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages. The report said securities firms \"should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\" It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information. It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market. It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing. In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval. It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit. The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases. The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics. The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days. The current requirement is expressed in business days. It said so-called \"lockup\" devices, in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company's total common stock. Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace."}

{"label": "ship", "text": "EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY. As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added."}

He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct. He said he was happy with \"a good result\" for February but stressed a need for continued \"vigilance\" against inflation.

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said."}

Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weight of the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand. \"There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas,\" Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.

Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal. But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago. \"It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks),\" Mulroney said. Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, \"Things are running pretty quickly now.\" The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world's largest trading partnership. But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula. \"It's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now, along with the questions of the substance of the agreement,\" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has been highly critical of the talks in the past. But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a \"hard and fast formula.\" Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture. Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.

The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

A company spokesman said the company will take \"some writeoff\" in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further \"carryover\" writeoff in the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year. The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand. It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman. Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800. The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates."}

Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised. Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement. \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added. \"Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said. Standard and Poor's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt. The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>. Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work,\" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA."}

Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed. Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in electronics, trading, food and service industries. Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad. Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln. He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are part of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.

{"label": "earn", "text": "GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS. West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year."}

{"label": "iron-steel", "text": "EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY. European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes."}

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said."}

Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes. There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended. Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the same month last year, figures received by the ISO show. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar. Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was 237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before. Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show."}

Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9 sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for Bertone's steel-structured sports cars. Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association. Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants. Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection. The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said."}

Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. \"Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today,\" one trader said. Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. \"There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak,\" analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said. Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement. The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman said. Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing. Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on. \"Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products,\" he said. \"I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera,\" referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\""}

Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: \"It all depends on France.\" At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technology and assuring \"a mutual advantage.\" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in joint ventures.

He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.

In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date.

Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>. Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. \"They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth,\" said one arbitrager, who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. \"It makes sense,\" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But \"It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a 100 pct of the synergies.\" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. \"This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,\" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer, but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary, speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr \"bridge\" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues."}

{"label": "earn", "text": "SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD. Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account."}

Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.

The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.

A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy."}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it."}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE. Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year."}
{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE. The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said. The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.\" The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices. \"I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,\" he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine Fleming's Edwards said. \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,\" Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\""}

South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said \"yes, I think so.\" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said \"I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.\" But he added \"the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons.\" Speaking of his own country, he said \"We have made a lot of concessions already.\" He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said \"at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.\" South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton. The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs."}

{"label": "gnp", "text": "NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY. There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said. Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move. The sources today said the government's policy remained one of \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct. The sources said that with France's economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies."}
{"label": "acq", "text": "BASS GROUP SAYS IT HAS HAD TALKS ON TAFT &lt;TFB>. A group led by members of the wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, which holds a 24.9 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, said it has had talks about taking part in a move to take control of the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it has had discussions with other Taft stockholders and some company managers and directors \"concerning participation in a group to acquire control\" of the company. The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to continue evaluating Taft and \"will be involved in further discussions relating to the future control and direction\" of the company. The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may decide to sell some or all of its stake. On Friday Taft said it would negotiate with a group led by its vice chairman, Dudley Taft, and a Rhode Island investment firm, which had offered 150 dlrs a share for the company. The Dudley Taft group, Theta Corp, which also includes Narragansett Capital Corp, a Providence, R.I., investment firm, is seeking to take the company private in a leveraged buyout valued at 1.38 billion dlrs. Besides the Bass group, another major Taft shareholder, Cincinnati, Ohio, financier Carl Lindner, has also said he has had talks about increasing his stake in the company, taking part in a takeover effort, or launching one himself. Lindner controls 1,489,298 shares of Taft common stock, or 16.2 pct of the total."}
{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS. Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March."}
