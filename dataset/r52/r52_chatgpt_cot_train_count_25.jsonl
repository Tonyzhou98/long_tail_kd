William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile tender within a week. Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate GenCorp while \"we have had only 10 days to respond.\" Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday. Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has already approved the station's sale. Money from the sale of the station will play a role in helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds said. He provided no other details. Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting, which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About 300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm. Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters. Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members have been telling him \"Bill, just don't pay greenmail\" to end the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds said he considers it a \"repugnant device.\" Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors. Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board. Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to \"stiffen the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail.\" Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they are open to negotiations with GenCorp. Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted \"we're developing alternatives that would not result in a change in control.\" Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, \"We know the company, we know the values and we know the opportunities better than any outside group.\" In response to a question about whether any units are up for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.", "rationale": "The news story provided pertains to a corporate event involving GenCorp and a hostile tender offer for the company's shares.

An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business.

Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period.

Employers in Rotterdam's troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters. Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector. The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers' plans for 350 redundancies this year. A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7. Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case. \"We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business, and further delays would do even more damage,\" Zeebregts said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY. Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about Ecuador's suspension of crude oil exports due to an earthquake that damaged an oil pipeline.

Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said. The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.

{"label": "interest", "text": "INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE. The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct by one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said. A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market. Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees.

{"label": "earn", "text": "CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS. Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash.", "rationale": "The news story provided primarily discusses the negotiations regarding Brazil's debt rescheduling and the financial implications for Continental Illinois Corp.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET. Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding the export tender system.", "rationale": "The topic of this news story is sugar.", "prediction": "sugar"}

Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. \"We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,\" he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said.

Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. \"We did not ask any country to do anything.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around the U.S. trade deficit with Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs), specifically Taiwan and Korea, and discusses issues related to trade balances, import tariffs, currency valuations, and protectionist sentiment, all of which are central to the topic of trade.", "prediction": "trade"}

Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\" Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd.

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.

Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee. \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\" The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program. The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded.

Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS. Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said \"It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. \"The demand wasn't so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the German government's borrowing activity, bond yields, and the impact of foreign investment on the German bond market, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"interest.\" This is because the central theme of the article is about interest rates on government bonds and how they are affected by various economic factors, including borrowing needs and foreign investor behavior.

{"label": "earn", "text": "GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER. One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no one order will have much of an effect on the stock.\" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order \"will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting \"significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.\"", "rationale": "The news story revolves around General Electric Co's (GE) profit outlook, which has been positively influenced by a new engine order for aircraft.

Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale &lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier. WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending. The statement said WestLB International's business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year. This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.

{"label": "jobs", "text": "JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT. Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used,\" one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided set is \"jobs.\" This is because the central focus of the article is on Japan's rising unemployment rate and the impact on the job market, including layoffs in various industries and government measures to help people find employment.", "prediction": "jobs"}

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce \"reasonable stability\" in exchange markets over the next few months. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to give time for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was affected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.

{"label": "gold", "text": "NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD. A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.\" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.\" The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,\" he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high,\" he said.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the emergence of a new market in warrants for gold.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING. The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987. The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on domestic interest rates, inflation rates, investment climate, and monetary policy, the most appropriate topic to assign from the given set would be \"interest.\" This topic directly relates to the central theme of the story, which is the discussion around the continuation of low interest rates in Germany and the implications for the economy.", "prediction": "tin"}

Madagascar's available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said.

The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985. Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS. The Bundesbank's options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the influence of German wage negotiations on the country's monetary policy, particularly how it impacts the actions of the Bundesbank.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>. A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20 days from the day we mail,\" said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the company,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs.

Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.

They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.

Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.

Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs, including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said. They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782 mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares. The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not included valuing the transaction. Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in Chrysler's earnings. A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since 1980. \"There were very serious discussions last fall but we didn't pull it off,\" the source said in a reference to the assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges Besse. \"It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor. And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done it before the end of last year.\" In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called \"an overhang to the company.\" Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25 mln dlrs in cash for \"transaction fees\" in connection with the acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid AMC shareholders. \"The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,\" analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters. Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12 billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal. But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC debt that is being carried at \"non-market\" rates.

Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS. China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said. He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around China's sugar imports, domestic sugar production, demand, and pricing issues, the topic for this news story should be \"sugar.\" This topic encompasses the main focus of the article, which is the sugar industry and market in China.", "prediction": "sugar"}
{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said. \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the \"must buy\" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said. \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story provided, the topic that best fits is \"cocoa.\" The story discusses the International Cocoa Organization's (ICCO) buffer stock operations, the impact on cocoa prices, the surplus of cocoa on the market, and the potential effects of future purchasing by the buffer stock on cocoa prices and the market.

The federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe.

{"label": "grain", "text": "SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE. Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,\" Martell said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"grain\" as the story primarily focuses on the condition, prospects, and potential issues related to the Soviet grain harvest.

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE. Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. \"We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,\" Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.\" He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about semiconductor production, trade tensions between Japan and the U.S., and the potential impact on the electronics market due to production cutbacks and tariffs.

{"label": "grain", "text": "U.S. GRAIN CERTS SAVE 50-100 MLN DLRS - AMSTUTZ. The use of generic commodity certificates, or \"certs,\" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs. However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said. Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC. In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory, he said. When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government, Amstutz said, \"GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs\" of the certificate program. Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures. GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said. \"There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,\" Amstutz said. Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs, he said. Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range market-oriented farm policy, he said. Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the financial implications and benefits of using generic commodity certificates in the context of U.S. grain.

Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and securities. In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, \"I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\" He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift, insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines. \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would have to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said. Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries. Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serve as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank's capital. \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth.\" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company, again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING. A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday.

{"label": "acq", "text": "AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS. American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story would be \"acq\" for acquisitions, as the story discusses American Express considering strategic options for its brokerage unit Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, which could include a spinoff, selling a stake, or other growth plans.

{"label": "trade", "text": "U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL. The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods. The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said. \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said. The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year. But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries.

{"label": "crude", "text": "LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE. Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on tax relief measures for oil producers in the North Sea, the topic that should be assigned to this news story is \"crude.\" The story discusses the impact of tax changes on the economics of oil field development, oil-related research, and the offshore supplies industry, all of which are directly related to the crude oil sector.", "prediction": "crude"}

Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\" Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said, an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. \"It's a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined.

The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports. Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" shares of stock. In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert.

Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results. Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories. But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery. The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base.

The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story should be \"sugar\" as it primarily discusses the dynamics of the world sugar market, including price changes, buying activities by countries like the Soviet Union and China, production estimates from various countries, and market supply and demand.

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS. Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure. \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election. \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There's been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's U.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately. \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28. On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes,\" said McGroarty of Discount.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the actions of central banks in response to currency movements and their efforts to stabilize exchange rates as agreed upon in the G-6 accord.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS. The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws. The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries. The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge. The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved. In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties. The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers. President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991. The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989. It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991. Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years.

{"label": "interest", "text": "ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE. British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,\" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. \"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the potential impact of the U.K. Central government's borrowing target on bank base lending rates, currency, money markets, and interest rates.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM. West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said. The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said. Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. \"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study. It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar. West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline. \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November. Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package. The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing. The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.", "rationale": "The news story discusses various factors influencing West German bond yields, including exchange rate stabilization efforts, central bank intervention, interest rate policies, and the impact of fiscal measures such as tax cuts on government borrowing.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN. Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time. She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way. \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.

{"label": "earn", "text": "ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE. State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus Industrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.

Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: \"We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\" He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE. The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that's Baker's strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around the U.S. Treasury, economic policies, currency management, and international economic cooperation, the most fitting topic from the provided set would be \"money-fx\" (which stands for money-foreign exchange).

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS. The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the relaxation of exchange controls in Spain, with implications for the banking sector, currency operations, and financial deregulation.

{"label": "earn", "text": "ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS. American Telephone and Telegraph Co's proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it should help the company's profits, analysts said. \"Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large volume users, but status quo for residential users,\" said PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman. But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has constrained the company's profits in the long distance business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said. ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct. Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to its competitors to oppose it filings. MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition in the telephone business. Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in the industry, simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces. \"You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,\" said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. \"But you wouldn't see a rise.\" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. \"It will give ATT a lot more flexibility,\" he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC hearings. It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>. \"We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,\" a U.S. Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed to greater competition. It may also take some time for the proposals to go through, and in the process they may be altered by the various constituencies affected by the move. \"There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it won't happen that fast,\" said analyst Victor Krueger of the Gartner Group.", "rationale": "The news story is about a proposal from American Telephone and Telegraph Co (AT&T) to deregulate its long-distance phone service, which analysts believe will help the company's profits without radically changing phone rates for consumers.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION. Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. \"We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,\" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. \"At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers said, \"but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene).\" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"money-fx,\" which stands for money-foreign exchange.

{"label": "crude", "text": "EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING. OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.

{"label": "earn", "text": "SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD. Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around the performance of Saudi banks, their profits, provisions for non-performing loans, and overall banking sector challenges within the Saudi economy, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"banking\" or \"financial services.\" However, since these exact options are not available in the set provided, the closest relevant topic from the list is \"reserves\" as the story discusses banks setting aside provisions to cover bad and doubtful debts, which is essentially a form of reserve.

{"label": "ship", "text": "EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY. As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided set is \"ship,\" as the main focus of the story is on the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise, which is related to maritime safety and the design of roll-on roll-off (RoRo) type ships.", "prediction": "ship"}
{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements.\" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981.", "rationale": "The most appropriate topic for the news story provided is \"trade.\" The story discusses a major trade bill in the U.S. Congress, debates between protectionists and free traders, and measures to enforce trade laws and address the trade deficit.

Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors.

It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.

The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners.

A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.\" Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.\" Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.\" Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms. \"Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,\" he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.

{"label": "grain", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND. \"If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on.\" Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years. \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up.\" \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year. \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures. \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it said. \"China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient.\" An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government. The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops. To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it. Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices. Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city grain prices without any problem. But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month. The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\" The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents. In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular. The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes. Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land. \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month. Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative. \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment,\" the newspaper said.", "rationale": "This news story pertains to agricultural issues, specifically the challenge of preserving farmland in China amid industrialization and population growth.

The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.

Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit and would use the proceeds to pay off debt. In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks, Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain to the public. The company will register a proposed offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters. \"Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,\" Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company would use much of the income from the amusement park chain, were it to be sold, to repay debt. Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at 350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said. Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six Flags by several prospective buyers. The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln dlrs mountain of debt. Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget Inc &lt;GNG.N>. The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs, or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs. Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in 1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs. Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982 from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from Marriott Corp &lt;mhs>. In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs. The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986, of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs. The company earlier this month said it will take a charge to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump. Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.

But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct. Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln. Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln. Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks. Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details. While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks.

{"label": "crude", "text": "WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA. World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around Indonesia's economic policies, debt, and adjustments in response to the slump in oil revenues, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"crude.\" The story focuses on the impact of falling oil prices on Indonesia's economy and the World Bank's involvement in urging policy changes to address these issues.

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR. Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.", "rationale": "This news story discusses the concerns and challenges faced by the private sector in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the context of an oil-dependent economy and the impact of fluctuating oil prices.

His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added. The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said.

The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\" Hair called the department's proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the conflict between wildlife conservation and the proposal for oil and gas exploration in Northern Alaska, specifically in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.", "rationale": "The news story is about Dart Group Corp's attempt to acquire Supermarkets General Corp, including discussions about the acquisition price, access to confidential information, and conditions related to company management's severance payments and other financial compensations.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT. The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. \"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,\" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the Bank of England's resistance to cut interest rates amidst market pressures and the impact on the British pound's value, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"interest.\" The story discusses interest rates, currency exchange rates, and monetary policy, all of which are directly related to the topic of interest rates and their effects on the financial markets.", "prediction": "interest"}

{"label": "acq", "text": "PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>. New Jersey-based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc, will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called \"bridge\" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said. \"Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future,\" said Idsal. William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.

{"label": "grain", "text": "DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL. A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, told Reuters. Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague. The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country. Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board. The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10. The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the company is not being made public. The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg, and \"as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.\" Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS. Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity.

The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers. But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate. The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages. The report said securities firms \"should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\" It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information. It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market. It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing. In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval. It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares.

Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.

Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way. \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.

A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.

Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product.

Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.

{"label": "acq", "text": "NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND. Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the purchase of a stake in a brokerage firm by a life insurance company and the broader trend of Japanese insurers investing in foreign financial institutions.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX. The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities.", "rationale": "This news story discusses the consideration of a commodity basket index by the U.S. Federal Reserve to help guide monetary policy.
