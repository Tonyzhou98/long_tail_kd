Time Inc's chief financial officer, Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is \"comfortable\" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share. In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share, including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced.  On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time. In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest acquisition ever. N.J.

He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes.

U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists.

They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses.

Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said.

Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,\" Martell said.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the potential impact of weather conditions on the Soviet Union's grain harvest.

The use of generic commodity certificates, or \"certs,\" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.

Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area.

One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said.

Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.", "rationale": "The news story is about Bolivia's economic situation, its relationship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and its efforts to manage and reduce its foreign debt.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS. Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.", "rationale": "The news story is about the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) and their plan to limit tin exports in order to reduce the world surplus and increase prices.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA. Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.

Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said. \"We don't intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.

Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955.

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the oil industry and the proposed tax breaks to stimulate activity within that industry.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION. Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the oil industry in California, specifically the drilling activity, oil production levels, and the impact of oil prices on these activities.

OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: \"OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. \"For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,\" Al-Wattari said. \"Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.

{"label": "crude", "text": "BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES. The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY. Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the primary focus is on Saudi Arabia's economic situation, particularly in relation to oil revenues and the balancing of its economy through austerity measures and the role of the private sector.

Producers of industrial materials operated at 78.9 pct of capacity, the same as in January and December, but down from the February 1986 rate of 79.6 pct. The Fed said the decline in energy materials use and durables goods materials were the reason for the decline over the past year for producers of industrial materials.", "rationale": "The news story does not focus on a specific commodity or sector but rather provides an overview of the capacity utilization across various sectors in the U.S. economy. It mentions factories, mines, utilities, automobile assemblies, primary metals production, durables manufacturing, nondurable manufacturing, fabricated metals, motor vehicles and parts, petroleum products, and industrial materials. However, the story does not delve into the specifics of any one sector or commodity. It does not discuss the trade of these commodities, their prices, or any specific issues related to them. Instead, it focuses on the capacity utilization rates of these sectors, which is a measure of how effectively the productive capacity of a nation is being used. Therefore, the most appropriate topic for this news story from the given set would be 'ipi' which stands for Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. This is because the story is essentially discussing the changes in capacity utilization rates across various sectors in the U.S. economy.", "prediction": "tea"}

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference. Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a \"memorandum of understanding\" on cargo preference. Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money. The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said. Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet. \"As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet,\" Kay said. Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.

{"label": "ship", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY. Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the challenges and recovery plans of Japan's shipbuilding industry.

U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.

{"label": "retail", "text": "FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN. U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\" said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber. Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. \"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales,\" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan. Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period. Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest. Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago. \"February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

{"label": "retail", "text": "FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN. U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\" said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber. Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. \"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales,\" said Sears chairman Edward Brennan. Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period. Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest. Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago. \"February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

{"label": "gold", "text": "PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING. A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\" Hofer said. \"I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,\" he added.

However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru in the same month.

Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good. Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota. Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year. USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report. The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are \"just awful,\" said Carter. In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association. \"The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,\" Markwart said. In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said. USDA's report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good. Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze. Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year, cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said. In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association. The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said. The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said. \"We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years,\" said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.

China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details.

It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said. He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around China's sugar imports, domestic sugar production, demand, and pricing issues, the topic for this news story should be \"sugar.\" This topic encompasses the main focus of the article, which is the sugar industry and market in China.", "prediction": "sugar"}

The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. \"With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines,\" Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period \"we could get away without having to increase the quota.\" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request. Following the refiners' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said. Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.

The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal.

The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 Ecus below this level. But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers. The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores. The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it.

European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.

Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes, provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products, typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system, which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer proportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw, insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account. The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry.", "rationale": "The news story is about the European Community (EC) industry ministers agreeing on the need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to balance capacity with demand.

A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS. Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. \"We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,\" he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic...

President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday. \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters. \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said. The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries. They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said. Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is that there will be.\" \"Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.

But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt dumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products. The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market. In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.

A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics.

The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said.

Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.

India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.

Emery Air Freight Corp said it plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp. The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding. On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator. But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own. Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28, unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate, payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued, interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in additional notes, Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company. \"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future,\" Emery's chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer, which was released several hours after the stock market had closed. Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.

{"label": "acq", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS. More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore. \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity. \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\" A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on Japanese corporations acquiring overseas companies, particularly in the United States and Europe.

{"label": "acq", "text": "SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES. The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said.

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade). He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies. Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct. Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits. Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange.

{"label": "acq", "text": "DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID. &lt;Dart Group Corp> said it told Supermarkets General Corp &lt;SGL> it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.", "rationale": "The news story is about Dart Group Corp's attempt to acquire Supermarkets General Corp, including discussions about the acquisition price, access to confidential information, and conditions related to company management's severance payments and other financial compensations.

{"label": "tea", "text": "ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS. Abnormally high levels of radiation were found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow were advised this week. In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts. Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University, including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were found to be free of radiation, it said. Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts. The products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected. \"We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it,\" a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months. \"Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals,\" he said. \"If the tests had shown abnormal readings, they would have been resumed.\"", "rationale": "The news story does not fit perfectly into any of the given topics as it primarily discusses radiation levels in food products, specifically tea and hazelnuts, from the Soviet Union.

(it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market,\" a source at one broking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday. \"The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,\" he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan, Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major markets for its tea, the sources added.

Pakistan's decision to suspend tea import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi broking houses and exporters said. Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports. The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports. The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the trade imbalance for some time. \"We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ... (it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market,\" a source at one broking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday. \"The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,\" he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan, Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major markets for its tea, the sources added. Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer to find new outlets, they said.", "rationale": "The news story is about Pakistan's decision to suspend tea import licenses, which is expected to negatively impact Kenyan tea exports.

The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.

The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said. Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.

The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.

The Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said.

Chile is the world's leading copper exporter and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income. The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents. But the left-wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations. Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October. Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating. The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO following a strike in 1983.

{"label": "copper", "text": "TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS. Copper shares, which have lagged behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said. \"Copper prices should move up over the next four to six quarters,\" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. \"I see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world economic growth.\" Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988. Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer. But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its copper operations to its shareholders. \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play and benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said. William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co, said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining operations. \"They've accomplished a great deal,\" he said. The company's move into carbon black, a product used in tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said. He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986. Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps. Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this year and around 3.50 dlrs next year. \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from its current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40. \"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,\" said Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. \"The shares will outperform the market over the next 18 months,\" he said. But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. \"We'd rather place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a significant premium to the current stock price,\" he said. After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co &lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations, Toufexis noted. Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in 1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40 dlrs from operations in 1986. \"I'd be buying up to 90,\" Toufexis said last week, when the stock rose sharply to near that level. \"But the shares are probably worth about 108 dlrs (each).\" Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988. Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co &lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in coal and other minerals aside from copper.

{"label": "copper", "text": "TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS. Copper shares, which have lagged behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said. \"Copper prices should move up over the next four to six quarters,\" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. \"I see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world economic growth.\" Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988. Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer. But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its copper operations to its shareholders. \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play and benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said. William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co, said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining operations. \"They've accomplished a great deal,\" he said. The company's move into carbon black, a product used in tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said. He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986. Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps. Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this year and around 3.50 dlrs next year. \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from its current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40. \"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,\" said Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. \"The shares will outperform the market over the next 18 months,\" he said. But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. \"We'd rather place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a significant premium to the current stock price,\" he said. After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co &lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations, Toufexis noted. Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in 1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40 dlrs from operations in 1986. \"I'd be buying up to 90,\" Toufexis said last week, when the stock rose sharply to near that level. \"But the shares are probably worth about 108 dlrs (each).\" Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988. Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co &lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in coal and other minerals aside from copper.

Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil. Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.", "rationale": "Based on the information provided in the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"alum\" as the primary subject matter of the article is the projected growth in aluminium capacity and its implications for the aluminium industry.

Preliminary talks are on between two state-owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC) which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said. G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect. \"It is the other way round,\" Valentchits said. He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, had approached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year. \"We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project,\" Valentchits said. He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were \"only just initial.\" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment. Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation. The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure. Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the lead agent. The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed by Citicorp. It said the government's privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm. The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors. The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos. NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is about the pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is specifically discussing the cocoa crop and its potential yield due to weather conditions and disease.

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.

Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.

Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme.

Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. \"The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week,\" Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said.

{"label": "jobs", "text": "FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT. The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation. The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program. Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show. The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market. Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.", "rationale": "The news story is about the French government's plan to combat long-term unemployment through a three billion franc program.

A new method of calculating Sweden's unemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said, reporting a substantial drop in the past year. According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless in February representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000 or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986. SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation. Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed by about 16 pct. \"The way we are now collecting data is far more accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out whether the jobless want work, whether they are able to work and whether they have actually looked for work,\" he told Reuters. The new method was first used for the January figures, which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce from 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the change had apparently not been noticed by the press.

Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods.

Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods.

Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.

Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.

{"label": "gas", "text": "ENERGY/U.S. REFINING. U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. \"If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said. \"The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,\" Martin said. \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation.\" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the concerns of U.S. refiners regarding increasing imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a new grade of unleaded gasoline.

{"label": "gas", "text": "ENERGY/U.S. REFINING. U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. \"If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said. \"The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,\" Martin said. \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation.\" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the concerns of U.S. refiners regarding increasing imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a new grade of unleaded gasoline.

The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the concerns of U.S. refiners regarding increasing imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a new grade of unleaded gasoline.

U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. \"If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>.

Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes. The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990. The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards. There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures. The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said. West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21. But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol. Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol. Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws.

{"label": "lumber", "text": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the potential economic and social impacts of the destruction of tropical rain forests, particularly in developing nations. It highlights the potential for a new debt crisis due to the loss of trade and resources, such as timber and other forest products.

Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that \"it's possible it would be.\" Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product.

Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers.

{"label": "lumber", "text": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the potential economic and social impacts of the destruction of tropical rain forests, particularly in developing nations.

The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery.

Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels.

Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts.

Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT. The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\" The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the economic forecast and situation of West Germany, particularly mentioning the gross national product (GNP) growth, exports, domestic consumption, investment spending, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, and fiscal policy.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY. The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT. The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\" The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the economic forecast and situation of West Germany, particularly mentioning the gross national product (GNP) growth, exports, domestic consumption, investment spending, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, and fiscal policy.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD. The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.

Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.

Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since the talks began last Monday. \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement,\" he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached.

Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.

Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT. Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement. \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said. Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers. \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future. \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations.", "rationale": "The news story is about the reaction of Asian countries to a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA).

{"label": "rubber", "text": "SRI LANKA TO UPROOT OR BUD DISEASED RUBBER TREES. Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned. The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN 2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058. Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102. These six varieties would also be used to replace trees uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said. Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge. \"But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,\" he added. De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the spread of the disease. \"The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably helped in some way because trees have not been affected in areas that are dry,\" he said.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT. European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European Community finance ministers and central bankers meeting to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float (the European Monetary System - EMS) and addressing issues related to currency market turbulence, exchange rates, and monetary integration.

Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said.

There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\" He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS).

A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING. A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\" \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten.\" David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar.\"", "rationale": "The news story is primarily discussing the implications of U.S. jobs data on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly in relation to non-farm payroll employment, manufacturing employment, construction employment, and overall labor force activity.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY. Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.

The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.

Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the issuance of a new government bond tranche by the Bank of England, the market's reaction to this announcement, and the context of interest rate pressures and expectations in the UK.

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE. The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the issuance of a new government bond tranche by the Bank of England, the market's reaction to this announcement, and the context of interest rate pressures and expectations in the UK.

Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another.

Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,\"  Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.

Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy court will hear its request today for a restraining order to stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp>. TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit to block Coastal from taking control. Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court. Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an undisclosed amount. TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about one billion dlrs. The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines. About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said. Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one billion in punitive damages from Coastal. Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market since 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.

Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. \"In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,\" Cardenas said.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the coffee industry and the impact of the International Coffee Organization's (ICO) inability to reach an agreement on export quotas.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES. The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said.

Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM. Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,\" he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,\" he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.\" Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\" He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. \"Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.\" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.", "rationale": "The news story discusses Colombia's approach to coffee marketing and export strategies in light of the challenges posed by the suspension of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas and current market conditions.

This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. \"The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,\" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. \"The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,\" he said. \"Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks,\" the roaster added.

The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,\" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export policy for coffee, as well as Brazil's position in the global coffee market following the failure of International Coffee Organization (ICO) talks.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM. Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,\" he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,\" he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.\" Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\" He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. \"Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.\" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.", "rationale": "The news story discusses Colombia's approach to coffee marketing and export strategies in light of the challenges posed by the suspension of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas and current market conditions.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER. New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.

At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES. The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said.

Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. \"The situation is unchanged,\" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. \"As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting.\" At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using \"objective criteria,\" which would likely have reduced Brazil's share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. \"As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags,\" he told Reuters.
