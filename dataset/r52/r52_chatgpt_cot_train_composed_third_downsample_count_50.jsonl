The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said.

OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.

Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.

Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank's plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in August 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back. \"There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks.

OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.

MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is \"crude,\" as the article discusses the recovery of Canada's oil industry, which is directly related to crude oil prices, the performance of oil companies, and the impact of government aid on the industry.", "prediction": "crude"}
{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR. Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC.

Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states.

{"label": "crude", "text": "TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN. The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,\" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said.

Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year.

{"label": "earn", "text": "SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH. Singapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.

China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of operation. General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study. Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters. Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso International Bank Ltd> in Macao. The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986. Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks.", "rationale": "The news story pertains to the financial performance and operations of a joint venture bank in China, specifically discussing its profits, loan and deposit figures, and ownership structure.

Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar.

Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is specifically discussing the cocoa crop and its potential yield due to weather conditions and disease.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is specifically discussing the cocoa crop and its potential yield due to weather conditions and disease.

More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a \"zero certificate case,\" where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled \"adequate certificate case\" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.

The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined.

{"label": "grain", "text": "ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET. The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\" \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs.

Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. \"We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions,\" Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.

Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.

Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weight of the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand. \"There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas,\" Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said. The current ICO quota system is \"unfair and autocratic,\" Escalante said.

Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday.

The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED. Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating. \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic to assign to this news story from the provided set is \"coffee.\" The story focuses on the short-lived price fall of coffee, the impact of failing to agree on new export quotas at the International Coffee Organisation meeting, and how Ivory Coast, a major coffee producer, is responding to the situation.", "prediction": "tin"}

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale.", "rationale": "The news story is related to the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export pricing system for coffee.

Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said.

West Germany's money supply growth slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply, short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January. In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January. Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct. In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash and sight deposits, rose seven pct. International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said. Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise. But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said. Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February. A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities. At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level. The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said. Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank. Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January.

{"label": "money-supply", "text": "FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY. The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data.

{"label": "cotton", "text": "ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES. U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.", "rationale": "Given the content of the news story, which is focused on the U.S. cotton seedings, acreage, and market analysis, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story from the provided set would be \"cotton.\"", "prediction": "cotton"}

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.

Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation.\" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\"", "rationale": "The news story you provided pertains to a meeting of major industrial nations discussing policies related to currency stabilization, bands not being published to avoid speculation, and the UK's stance on its own currency and interest rates.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION. Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.", "rationale": "The news story discusses financial and economic issues related to Sudan's dealings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), specifically regarding currency devaluation, state subsidies, foreign debt, and debt servicing.

The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985.

The dollar's tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22.

They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said. The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said. They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.

The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. \"I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. \"I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said.

{"label": "tin", "text": "TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED. Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin \"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA. Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS. Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA. Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"instal-debt.\" The story discusses Bolivia's economic situation concerning its debt, negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and strategies for managing and repaying its foreign debt.

{"label": "alum", "text": "ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT. Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil.

{"label": "reserves", "text": "MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS. Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987.

{"label": "ship", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY. Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the challenges and recovery plans of Japan's shipbuilding industry.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>. Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate, analysts said. Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention. Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory limbo. Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over 25 pct. \"This gives them plenty of borrowing power,\" he said, which could be used against an unwanted suitor. Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs. Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover. \"I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern,\" one Santa Fe executive said about Henley. \"I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe,\" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers Henley for DLJ Securities. Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo, sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future. These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment. The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad. Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds. The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to merge the lines. \"My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings,\" Fischer said. \"I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's objections,\" he said. \"But in doing so they haven't pleased everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side, now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up.\" If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up to another year for the ICC to decide. Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a spokesman said. Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said. James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake. \"It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low-risk, opportunistic investment,\" Voytko said. \"People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share,\" said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. \"But I'm certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than that in breakup value.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which primarily discusses Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp's challenges in merging its two railroad properties, speculation about a possible takeover by Henley Group, and the company's financial strategies to deter unwanted suitors, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"acq\" (acquisition).

{"label": "acq", "text": "GENCORP &lt;GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS. An investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting. \"We might be able to see some additional value if we could meet\" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for the investor group. Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds \"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time.\" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with Reynolds, Reed said. Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs. Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE. Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be more viable if merged with another tire company. \"One option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition,\" Reed said. He said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry. Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success, he said. In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations, Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations. The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs. The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would get about 103 mln dlrs. The partners also said the Federal Communications Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit. Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer. He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations. Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is headquartered, Reed said, \"the plan of the partners offers long term growth for Ohio.\" He noted that the aerospace business, slated for divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California. \"Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments,\" he said.", "rationale": "The news story provided does not fall under any of the specific commodity or financial instrument categories listed.

The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports.

By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert.

The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign is \"instal-debt.\" This story discusses the U.S. government's urging of commercial banks to consider a new proposal from the Philippines regarding the payment of its interest bill, as part of the broader context of Third World debt strategy.

Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct. Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around Thai banks considering a reduction in interest rates to stimulate loan demand and manage high liquidity in the money market, the most appropriate topic to assign from the provided set would be \"interest.\" The story discusses potential changes to deposit and lending rates, the impact of these rates on the banking sector's profits, and the overall lending growth in comparison to bank deposit expansion.

Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said.

The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. \"Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,\" one dealer said.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE. Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. \"I think it's a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said. \"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\" \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow.

U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein. \"I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts. \"February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\" said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.

Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA. Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment. The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT. Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they're on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.

Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment. The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.

Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA. Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment. The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.

Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.

He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied.

A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.\" But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. \"It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said. \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story should be \"trade,\" as the main focus is on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations and the discussion of bilateral trade problems between countries.

{"label": "trade", "text": "OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS. The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called \"mixed credits,\" the OECD said. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use. \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here commented.", "rationale": "The news story is about reforms agreed upon by OECD countries regarding export credits, particularly those provided to developing countries.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives and discussions around protectionist measures and free trade, the topic assigned to this news story is \"trade.\"", "prediction": "trade"}

External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute. In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments. Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected. \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said. Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S. \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies. \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around a trade dispute between Canada and the United States regarding Canadian potash exports.

Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further. \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market. \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European sugar beet plantings and their implications for sugar production and market dynamics.

The International Sugar Agreement (ISA) will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact's council. A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses, he said. But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget. At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact. The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET. Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR. French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"sugar.\"", "prediction": "sugar"}

Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.

{"label": "livestock", "text": "ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY. A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked.\" The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.\"", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the given set is \"livestock.\" The story discusses the use of antibiotics in cattle feed and the resulting development of drug-resistant strains of salmonella that can infect humans.

This comes as a result of weather forecasts predicting a colder than average winter in the Northeast, where heating oil is predominantly used. The EIA also noted that the current inventory levels of heating oil are lower than the five-year average, which could further drive up prices. Market analysts suggest that consumers should prepare for higher heating costs this winter. The increase in heating oil prices is also expected to impact the futures market, with potential for significant price volatility.\"", "rationale": "The news story does not provide information about a specific commodity such as copper, livestock, gold, etc. However, it discusses the expected increase in demand for heating oil as winter approaches, which is related to the energy industry.

A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION. Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. \"We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon.\" Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. \"I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. \"I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. \"It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.", "rationale": "The news story provided primarily discusses the merger and acquisition activity within the airline industry, specifically involving Trans World Airlines Inc (TWA), Piedmont Aviation Inc, and USAir Group.

{"label": "interest", "text": "ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE. British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,\" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. \"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the potential impact of the U.K. Central government's borrowing target on bank base lending rates, currency, money markets, and interest rates.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN. The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit. \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years. \"I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,\" Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the tensions between the United States and Japan regarding trade deficits, surpluses, and barriers, as well as the U.S. legislative response to these issues, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"trade.\"", "prediction": "trade"}

The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said. The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985. Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet. The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985. Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers. Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.

Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December. The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said.

{"label": "acq", "text": "BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES. British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted. The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc> unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night's close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's own resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment. Walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment. Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said. However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, Spedding said. BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around British Petroleum Co Plc's (BP) tender offer to acquire the remaining shares of Standard Oil Co that it does not already own, the most relevant topic to assign from the provided set would be \"acq\" for acquisitions.

Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week. \"We got a little volatility Wednesday,\" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. \"But for the moment we're still in a trading range.\" Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said. \"It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. \"It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,\" he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace. \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said. \"We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,\" compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said. In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures.

They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.", "rationale": "The news story provided is specifically about Saudi Arabia's crude oil output and exports, as well as its adherence to OPEC quotas and pricing.

The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues.

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

The use of generic commodity certificates, or \"certs,\" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs. However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said. Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC. In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory, he said. When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government, Amstutz said, \"GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs\" of the certificate program. Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures. GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said. \"There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,\" Amstutz said. Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs, he said. Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range market-oriented farm policy, he said. Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the financial implications and benefits of using generic commodity certificates in the context of U.S. grain.

Emery Air Freight Corp said it plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp. The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding. On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator. But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own. Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28, unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate, payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued, interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in additional notes, Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company. \"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future,\" Emery's chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer, which was released several hours after the stock market had closed. Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.

Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at \"international markets\" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports \"was probably about right.\" European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy. Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs. A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details. The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business. In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was \"apparently still organising finance,\" his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.

Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's European business was apparently rejected in favour of Ferruzzi's lower bid. Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said \"Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC's European business.\" Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under study, he added.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "SRI LANKA TO UPROOT OR BUD DISEASED RUBBER TREES. Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned. The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN 2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058. Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102. These six varieties would also be used to replace trees uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said. Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge. \"But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,\" he added. De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the spread of the disease. \"The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably helped in some way because trees have not been affected in areas that are dry,\" he said. Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it has not caused a drop in production.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said. O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration. A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs, to go through as planned later today. The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.

The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company. After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new Delta outfits. Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night. At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines. While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS. The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the relaxation of exchange controls in Spain, with implications for the banking sector, currency operations, and financial deregulation.

{"label": "acq", "text": "FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR. Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\" Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said, an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. \"It's a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined. The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a \"lock-up\" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the proposed merger of Fleet Financial Group with Norstar Bancorp, which is related to the banking industry and financial markets.

{"label": "acq", "text": "TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>. A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20 days from the day we mail,\" said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the company,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS. German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING. A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\" \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten.\" David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar.\"", "rationale": "The news story is primarily discussing the implications of U.S. jobs data on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly in relation to non-farm payroll employment, manufacturing employment, construction employment, and overall labor force activity.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY. The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.

Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said.

Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.

It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.

The new accord is due to replace the current one, which expires in October.

Xuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we often faced problems.\" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it.

Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto added. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.\" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers, said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.\" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers, agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.

A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share. In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks' own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board, to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in. A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers. Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems. \"We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,\" he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY. Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the primary focus is on Saudi Arabia's economic situation, particularly in relation to oil revenues and the balancing of its economy through austerity measures and the role of the private sector.

{"label": "alum", "text": "NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE. The London Metal Exchange's, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract. This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the introduction of a new dollar-denominated aluminium contract by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and its implications for the trade, particularly with the addition of Singapore as a delivery point.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.

The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct. The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad. The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.

Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.

{"label": "earn", "text": "BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS. British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L> profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years. He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter's results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's close and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.

{"label": "lumber", "text": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the environmental, economic, and social implications of deforestation in tropical rainforests, and its potential impact on the debt crisis for developing countries.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around the U.S. trade deficit with Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs), specifically Taiwan and Korea, and discusses issues related to trade balances, import tariffs, currency valuations, and protectionist sentiment, all of which are central to the topic of trade.", "prediction": "trade"}

British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows.

Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal.

{"label": "gold", "text": "NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD. A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.\" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.\" The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,\" he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high,\" he said.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the emergence of a new market in warrants for gold.

{"label": "ship", "text": "EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY. As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the provided set is \"ship,\" as the main focus of the story is on the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise, which is related to maritime safety and the design of roll-on roll-off (RoRo) type ships.", "prediction": "ship"}

During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said. \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the \"must buy\" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said. \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story provided, the topic that best fits is \"cocoa.\" The story discusses the International Cocoa Organization's (ICCO) buffer stock operations, the impact on cocoa prices, the surplus of cocoa on the market, and the potential effects of future purchasing by the buffer stock on cocoa prices and the market.

A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.

Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION. Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year's pace, economists said. \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month. The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets. Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges. \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct. Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture. \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

{"label": "acq", "text": "SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>. &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel. For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs. MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board. MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>, has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in \"mezzanine\" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that \"The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.\" Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat.  \"My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration,\" he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. \"As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition,\" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.", "rationale": "This news story is about Martin T.
