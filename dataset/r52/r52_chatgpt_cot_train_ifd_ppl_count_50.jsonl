Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. \"An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community,\" Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, \"otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan.\" Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. \"Something must give soon.

Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end.

But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.

Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March.

Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. \"Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute.

Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. \"There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's annual report says.

As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change \"in its entirety\" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules, and although the impact will not be material in the short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report said.

Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place, the report said.

As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said.

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive. \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\" Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable touch of the budget.\" Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got.

Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the financial performance of Audi AG, including details about their profits, turnover, dividends, sales, market share, and workforce.

Preliminary talks are on between two state-owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC) which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said. G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect. \"It is the other way round,\" Valentchits said. He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, had approached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year. \"We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project,\" Valentchits said. He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were \"only just initial.\" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment. Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation. The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure.

It said the government's privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm. The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors. The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos. NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties. The firm produced 1,863 tonnes of nickel in the first two months of 1986, compared with 2,364 tonnes in the same period in 1985. The mine's capacity is 2,000 tonnes a month.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the situation of Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC), which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery.

He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.

He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs.

{"label": "copper", "text": "TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS. Copper shares, which have lagged behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said. \"Copper prices should move up over the next four to six quarters,\" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. \"I see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world economic growth.\" Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988. Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer. But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its copper operations to its shareholders. \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play and benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said. William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co, said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining operations. \"They've accomplished a great deal,\" he said. The company's move into carbon black, a product used in tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said. He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986. Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps. Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this year and around 3.50 dlrs next year. \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from its current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40. \"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,\" said Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. \"The shares will outperform the market over the next 18 months,\" he said. But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. \"We'd rather place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a significant premium to the current stock price,\" he said. After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co &lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations, Toufexis noted. Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in 1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40 dlrs from operations in 1986. \"I'd be buying up to 90,\" Toufexis said last week, when the stock rose sharply to near that level. \"But the shares are probably worth about 108 dlrs (each).\" Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988. Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co &lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in coal and other minerals aside from copper.

The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\" According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat said. \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,\" he added.", "rationale": "The topic for the provided news story is \"copper.\" The story discusses Zambia's decision to stop sending its copper exports through South Africa and the implications for Zambia's economy and trade routes.", "prediction": "copper"}

Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME. In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis. Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said. By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex. The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said. The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.

A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out. Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour. The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.

A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked.\" The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.\"", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story from the given set is \"livestock.\" The story discusses the use of antibiotics in cattle feed and the resulting development of drug-resistant strains of salmonella that can infect humans.

{"label": "gold", "text": "NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD. A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.\" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.\" The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,\" he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high,\" he said.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the emergence of a new market in warrants for gold.

{"label": "gold", "text": "PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING. A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\" Hofer said. \"I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,\" he added.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION. Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. \"We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,\" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. \"At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers said, \"but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene).\" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"money-fx,\" which stands for money-foreign exchange.

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.

But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.

Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.\" The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. \"If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,\" she said. \"But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.\" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. \"I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.\" Monsod said, \"The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing.\" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the Philippine Economic Planning Secretary urging for the devaluation of the peso to keep exports competitive, discussing exchange rates, and mentioning the country's inflation rates.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY. The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which is centered around the European Monetary System (EMS), its currency stability in Europe, and the challenges it faces in relation to world money markets and currency rates, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"money-fx\" (money-foreign exchange).

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS. Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure. \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election. \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There's been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's U.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately. \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL. Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,\" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS. German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added.", "rationale": "This news story discusses the regulatory considerations of German banking authorities regarding off-balance sheet activities, particularly focusing on financial instruments such as interest rate and currency swaps, as well as currency options.

Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING. A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.

The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.

The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted.

The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA. Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate, analysts said. \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said.

Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee. \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\" The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace.

Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the relaxation of exchange controls in Spain, with implications for the banking sector, currency operations, and financial deregulation.

Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES. Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London. The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade. Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points. About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday. Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in London. The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London. As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island. The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\" Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most suitable topic from the provided set is \"money-fx,\" which stands for money-foreign exchange.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY. The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted. The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said. Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said. \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said.

Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was affected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS. The Bundesbank's options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the influence of German wage negotiations on the country's monetary policy, particularly how it impacts the actions of the Bundesbank.

Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said.

Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION. Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.

A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.", "rationale": "The appropriate topic for this news story is \"money-fx,\" as the main focus is on the discussion of moving towards a unified currency system among Gulf Arab states and the coordination of fiscal and economic policies related to foreign exchange.", "prediction": "money-fx"}

The dollar's tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22. Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's tumble, securities house dealers said. They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said. The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said. They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said. A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market. The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said. Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986, Finance Ministry sources said. The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers said. Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said. \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian dollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at &lt;Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd> said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around Japanese investors, the behavior of the U.S. bond market, and the impact on currency exchange, particularly the dollar and yen, the most appropriate topic from the given set for this news story would be \"money-fx\" (money-foreign exchange).

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX. The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities.", "rationale": "This news story discusses the consideration of a commodity basket index by the U.S. Federal Reserve to help guide monetary policy.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED. The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. \"I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. \"I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said.

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments.\" Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports. Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said, \"You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris.\" The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct. West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany's exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany's economic growth this year. The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME. Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island's newly launched treasury bill programme. The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them. The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\" Under the current system, the agency provides the island's 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds. \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states. The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge. The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days. Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme. Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank. Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly. Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct. Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the topic that should be assigned to this story is \"money-fx\" as it discusses the introduction of a new domestic money market regime in Bahrain, changes to dinar liquidity aid, and the use of treasury bills and repurchase agreements, all of which are related to foreign exchange and money market operations.", "prediction": "money-fx"}

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.

Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation.\" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\"", "rationale": "The news story you provided pertains to a meeting of major industrial nations discussing policies related to currency stabilization, bands not being published to avoid speculation, and the UK's stance on its own currency and interest rates.

The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury.

Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that's Baker's strength too,\" the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around the U.S. Treasury, economic policies, currency management, and international economic cooperation, the most fitting topic from the provided set would be \"money-fx\" (which stands for money-foreign exchange).

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT. European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European Community finance ministers and central bankers meeting to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float (the European Monetary System - EMS) and addressing issues related to currency market turbulence, exchange rates, and monetary integration.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS. One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the impact of actions taken by large German banks on the liquidity of the domestic money market, and how this has affected the call money rate, which is the interest rate on short-term loans that banks give to each other.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING. A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\" \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten.\" David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar.\"", "rationale": "The news story is primarily discussing the implications of U.S. jobs data on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly in relation to non-farm payroll employment, manufacturing employment, construction employment, and overall labor force activity.

In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\" But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem.

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS. European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,\" Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on discussions among European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers regarding the reinforcement and stabilization of the European Monetary System (EMS).

{"label": "money-fx", "text": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING. U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said. \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\" Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen since the start of the year,\" Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\" Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.

Taiwan's industrial production index, fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by 8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised 152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said. It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year. The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82. A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation equipment, and less mining and house construction. The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar, which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.

The Soviet economy recovered slightly last month after a poor performance in January, but major industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of production targets, official figures show. Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the same period of last year. However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987. The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met their supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country's main export to Western nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from 97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse the stagnation in production which began in November 1983.

The Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so fast, he's stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said.

The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said.

Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanese government official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.. China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international Communism.\" The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said. \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,\" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers.

{"label": "trade", "text": "SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE. Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. \"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,\" he said. \"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,\" he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. \"The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,\" he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets. \"They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation,\" he said. \"Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad.\"", "rationale": "The news story is focused on Spain's efforts to boost its export levels to match European Community standards by implementing a plan that includes providing financial support and incentives to exporters, and enhancing their presence in international trade fairs.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS. Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\" \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\" He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most relevant topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story discusses the impact of U.S. sanctions on Poland's economy, the loss of Most Favoured Nation trading status, the subsequent effect on Polish exports and imports, and the broader implications for trade relations.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS. Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request. \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have.\" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec. Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said. Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said. \"It's like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, another opens.\" MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance. \"It's getting to be like communism,\" said one. But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss. \"They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses,\" Bache's Wolffe said. MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best. \"There has been some change, but it's not across the board,\" said one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree of urgency.\" The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added. Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.

A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.

A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system.

Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.

House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters.

They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements.\" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE. U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress.

A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products.

Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case. \"We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,\" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters. \"The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,\" he said. U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said. \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. \"I am optimistic,\" he added.", "rationale": "The news story concerns a U.S.-Japan pact regarding microchip trade, which is a part of the broader semiconductor industry.

Brazil's trade surplus doubled in February to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln but was well below the 628 mln dlrs of February last year, official figures show. Director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivatives, was only slightly below the same month last year. Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February, 1986, because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion. Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth. Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil. Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oil and wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period.

The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called \"mixed credits,\" the OECD said. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.

The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show. The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below the same month last year. Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added.

{"label": "trade", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around the U.S. trade deficit with Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs), specifically Taiwan and Korea, and discusses issues related to trade balances, import tariffs, currency valuations, and protectionist sentiment, all of which are central to the topic of trade.", "prediction": "trade"}

External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute. In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments. Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be protected. \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said. Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S. \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies. \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"trade.\" The story revolves around a trade dispute between Canada and the United States regarding Canadian potash exports.

But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry.

The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties. President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday. \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters. \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said. The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries. They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said. Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is that there will be.\" \"Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said. The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems. Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries. But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt dumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products. The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market. In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips. Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact. Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.

To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes. \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports. \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world,\" he said.

Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement. \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.\" Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October. He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.

Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further. \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market. \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said.

The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT. In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods. The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995.

{"label": "trade", "text": "INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP. India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the topic that best fits is \"trade.\" The story discusses India's efforts to engage in countertrade deals with non-communist countries to reduce its trade deficit, conserve foreign exchange, and cope with various economic challenges.

The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources said. \"We can't say \"yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)\" but this is definitely being considered,\" an official said. His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan. Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. \"There's a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan,\" another government official told Reuters. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access. She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said. The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show. A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to \"coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences\" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called \"restrictive conditions\" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market. The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action. Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament. 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said. The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements. \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance,\" one official said. \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times,\" the official added. Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said. British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan. \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" he said, adding \"(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.\" Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade \"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\" The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said. But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate. Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange. In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week.

The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said. The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.\" The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices. \"I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,\" he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine Fleming's Edwards said. \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,\" Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"", "rationale": "The news story discusses a trade dispute between Japan and the U.S. regarding the sale of computer chips, which are also known as semiconductors.

Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations.

Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners. \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement. \"I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity.

The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit. \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years. \"I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,\" Gephardt said.

Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.\" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. \"It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, \"We are not talking about days or weeks.

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS. Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult. \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They're well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said. \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" said Edwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter.

The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low. - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan. - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand.\" - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln.

Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. Of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. Action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said.

Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the political implications of trade friction between Japan and the United States, with a focus on the impact on Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's political standing.

Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated: \"EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement.\" \"We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to resist emotional biases,\" he said. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the pact. The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports. Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join. \"This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the Japanese market,\" he said.", "rationale": "The news story is about the conflict between Japanese computer chip makers and the United States over trade in computer microchips.

{"label": "trade", "text": "NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take \"appropriate measures\" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. \"It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date,\" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so.

The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan.

{"label": "trade", "text": "IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS. Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. \"There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects.

{"label": "trade", "text": "CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD. World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth. \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time,\" he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.\" The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy. \"We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\" Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.\" Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities. \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,\" Conable said. However, he said \"I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.\" He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.\" He added, \"so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution.\" On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.", "rationale": "The most suitable topic for this news story is \"trade.\" The story discusses concerns about trade protectionism, the U.S. imposing tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, and the World Bank's efforts to encourage open markets to promote global economic growth.

{"label": "trade", "text": "JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE. Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. \"We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,\" Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.\" He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about semiconductor production, trade tensions between Japan and the U.S., and the potential impact on the electronics market due to production cutbacks and tariffs.

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.

{"label": "trade", "text": "TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN. The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a \"bear\" market. \"It's the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets. \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\" said O'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\" Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  \"We're still in a bull market,\" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The bear usually strikes slowly.\" Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP. Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.", "rationale": "The news story is specifically discussing the cocoa crop and its potential yield due to weather conditions and disease.

French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS. The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would \"distort, not support\" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the market where trade buying is not.\" In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the most relevant topic to assign would be \"cocoa\" as the main focus of the article is on the negotiations surrounding the international cocoa market, the operation of a cocoa buffer stock, and the stability of cocoa prices.", "prediction": "cocoa"}
{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE. The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices,\" a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the \"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers.\" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.", "rationale": "The news story provided is centered on the cocoa market, discussing the agreement reached by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), the impact on cocoa prices, the buffer stock rules, and the concerns of various stakeholders including cocoa producers and consumers.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said. \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the \"must buy\" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said. \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story provided, the topic that best fits is \"cocoa.\" The story discusses the International Cocoa Organization's (ICCO) buffer stock operations, the impact on cocoa prices, the surplus of cocoa on the market, and the potential effects of future purchasing by the buffer stock on cocoa prices and the market.

Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters.

Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted.

But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around Mexico's financial reserves, loans, and dealings with international financial institutions and credit facilities, the topic that best fits this news story is \"reserves.\" The story specifically discusses the level of Mexico's reserves reaching eight billion dollars, the effects of capital inflows on these reserves, and related financial strategies and agreements with other countries and organizations.", "prediction": "reserves"}

Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week. Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date.", "rationale": "The news story is about Malaysia's consideration of whether to join the International Cocoa Agreement and the implications for local cocoa producers and traders.

French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS). Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said. This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments. The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc. On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.

Trade estimates of the coming May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago. Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier. Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing. Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags. The traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment. Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices. If such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease. Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant. The traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month, September.

European Community (EC) industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion, but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes, provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products, typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system, which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer proportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw, insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account.

{"label": "cocoa", "text": "COCOA BUFFER STOCK COMPROMISE GAINING ACCEPTANCE. A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said. \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"no problems\" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as \"just fiddling.\" But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said.

A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a \"very interesting stage of negotiations,\" delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added.

European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.

The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.

The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the \"may-buy\" level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions.

Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs.

{"label": "ship", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY. Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the challenges and recovery plans of Japan's shipbuilding industry.

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference. Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a \"memorandum of understanding\" on cargo preference. Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money. The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said. Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet. \"As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet,\" Kay said. Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.

{"label": "cotton", "text": "ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES. U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.", "rationale": "Given the content of the news story, which is focused on the U.S. cotton seedings, acreage, and market analysis, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story from the provided set would be \"cotton.\"", "prediction": "cotton"}

{"label": "alum", "text": "ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE. Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors. Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive. It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.

{"label": "alum", "text": "NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE. The London Metal Exchange's, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract. This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the introduction of a new dollar-denominated aluminium contract by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and its implications for the trade, particularly with the addition of Singapore as a delivery point.

Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil.

Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. \"The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,\" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.

In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.

The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the federal agency said in a statement.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT. The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\" The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the economic forecast and situation of West Germany, particularly mentioning the gross national product (GNP) growth, exports, domestic consumption, investment spending, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, and fiscal policy.

Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY. The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which discusses the state of Japan's economy, including aspects such as exports, government spending, corporate earnings, currency stabilization, and GNP figures, the most appropriate topic to assign to this news story would be \"gnp\" (Gross National Product).

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT. Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they're on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the differing opinions among U.S. economic officials regarding the reduction of the budget deficit, the effectiveness of tax policies, and economic growth projections.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.

The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December. WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added. A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.

{"label": "gnp", "text": "OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA. Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment.

The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS. China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said. He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around China's sugar imports, domestic sugar production, demand, and pricing issues, the topic for this news story should be \"sugar.\" This topic encompasses the main focus of the article, which is the sugar industry and market in China.", "prediction": "sugar"}
{"label": "sugar", "text": "EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.", "rationale": "The news story discusses European sugar beet plantings and their implications for sugar production and market dynamics.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT. Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said. Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost. The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA), told Reuters. However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output. \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,\" he said. Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go. \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.\" Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets. An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. \"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.\" In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the London-based International Sugar Organization. Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover. Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply. Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added. Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970. Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985. The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels. Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market. Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000. A national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru's production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain. At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region. Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency. The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year. Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace. Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles. However, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps. Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies. \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting. The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices. GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact. \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre said.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the state of the sugar industry in Latin America, including issues related to production costs, market prices, export quotas, and the impact of international policies on local economies.

Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.

The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET. Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding the export tender system.", "rationale": "The topic of this news story is sugar.", "prediction": "sugar"}

{"label": "sugar", "text": "PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES. Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,\" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino. \"I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.\" \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA's bid to control production. \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production. He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry. \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said. \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling. \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar,\" he said. Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984. \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said. \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\" He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound. \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,\" he said. Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production. He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup. \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.\" Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986. Yulo said despite next year's increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down. \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season.\"", "rationale": "The news story focuses primarily on the sugar industry in the Philippines, including production targets for the crop year, domestic consumption, export quotas, and potential diversification into ethanol production and other uses for sugarcane.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER. A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus \"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,\" one official said. \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about a leaf disease affecting rubber plantations in Sri Lanka, which may lead to a reduction in rubber output and impact rubber prices.

The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. \"The disease is extremely difficult to control.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS. The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, \"I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned.\" \"It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed.\" He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic \"that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled.\" Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile.

The new accord is due to replace the current one, which expires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented \"a historic moment.\" The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years. Xuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we often faced problems.\" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended, but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto added. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that prevailed throughout this session.\" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers, said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply.\" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers, agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.

{"label": "sugar", "text": "RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING. The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market.

Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good. Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota. Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year. USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report. The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are \"just awful,\" said Carter. In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association. \"The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,\" Markwart said. In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said. USDA's report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.

In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association. The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said. The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said. \"We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years,\" said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.

The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. \"With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines,\" Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period \"we could get away without having to increase the quota.\" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request. Following the refiners' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said.

French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"sugar.\"", "prediction": "sugar"}

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT. Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement. \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said. Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers. \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future. \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations.", "rationale": "The topic of this news story is clearly related to rubber, as the entire story discusses the impact of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) on rubber prices, the rubber industry, and the concerns of various stakeholders within the rubber market.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS. Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign would be \"tin,\" as the article discusses measures taken by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to curb tin exports with the aim of reducing the world surplus and boosting tin prices.

{"label": "tin", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA. Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports.

The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin \"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached.

Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.

{"label": "rubber", "text": "NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW. A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said. \"The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation,\" he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\" and \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto added. At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower intervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.", "rationale": "The news story is about the adoption of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), which is focused on stabilizing rubber prices and balancing demand and supply.

{"label": "interest", "text": "BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE. Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. \"I think it's a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said. \"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\" \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates.", "rationale": "Topic: money-supply", "prediction": "money-supply"}
{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT. The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. \"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,\" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the Bank of England's resistance to cut interest rates amidst market pressures and the impact on the British pound's value, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story is \"interest.\" The story discusses interest rates, currency exchange rates, and monetary policy, all of which are directly related to the topic of interest rates and their effects on the financial markets.", "prediction": "interest"}
{"label": "interest", "text": "BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES. This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range,\" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. \"If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.", "rationale": "The news story primarily discusses the Bank of England's actions regarding interest rates and their impact on the British pound (sterling) in relation to market expectations and government policy.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS. Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said \"It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. \"The demand wasn't so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in London said.

OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately.

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.

He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.

Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.

Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.

Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's.

On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. \"This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, \"Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.\" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.", "rationale": "This news story is focused on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the expansion of trading hours for energy futures, specifically mentioning the trading of oil and platinum futures.

{"label": "interest", "text": "U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN. The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the appropriate topic to assign is \"instal-debt.\" This story discusses the U.S. government's urging of commercial banks to consider a new proposal from the Philippines regarding the payment of its interest bill, as part of the broader context of Third World debt strategy.

{"label": "interest", "text": "NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES. U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. \"That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,\" said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; \"It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more.\" Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was \"of considerable significance.\" It said, \"the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.\" Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. \"National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months,\" he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts. \"The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this,\" one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market. \"We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,\" he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates. He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around U.K. interest rates, the suspension of a British National Savings issue, and implications for mortgage rates and inflation, the appropriate topic to assign from the provided set would be \"interest.\" This topic is central to the story as it discusses the changes in interest rates and their potential effects on the economy, particularly the financial markets and the housing sector in the context of mortgage rates.", "prediction": "housing"}

U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said. \"People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. \"We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates,\" Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for \"less than ebullient market action,\" Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range. \"My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified,\" Mains said.

Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979. \"The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal,\" Kahan said.

Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said. Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc. High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank. \"It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,\" one banker said.

{"label": "interest", "text": "ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE. British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,\" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. \"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets.

The margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2. The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year. Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaican delegation, called the terms very favourable to his country. The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee led by the Bank of Nova Scotia &lt;BNO.TO> comes five days after Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations. That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the compensatory financing facility. Of Jamaica's foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pct is owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed the government's policy of not seeking new bank loans.

But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.

Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.

The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.

Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.

Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.

In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details. He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. \"In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct,\" he said.

Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM. West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said. The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said. Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. \"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study. It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar. West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline. \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November. Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package. The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing. The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.", "rationale": "The news story discusses various factors influencing West German bond yields, including exchange rate stabilization efforts, central bank intervention, interest rate policies, and the impact of fiscal measures such as tax cuts on government borrowing.

{"label": "interest", "text": "GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING. The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.

{"label": "interest", "text": "VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES. Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week. \"We got a little volatility Wednesday,\" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. \"But for the moment we're still in a trading range.\" Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said. \"It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. \"It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,\" he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace. \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested.

{"label": "interest", "text": "THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT. Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said. They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said. Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said. Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.

The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks. A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate. The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January.

{"label": "interest", "text": "ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE. Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said. \"Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher. McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently. However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year. Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20. \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon. Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery. \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\" \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase. The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise \"may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\" Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans. The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move. In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds. The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct. Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates. But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.", "rationale": "The news story provided is centered around the changes in the U.S. prime rate, discussions of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, the cost of funds for banks, and the potential impact on interest rates and the economy.

The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT. Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.

Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.", "rationale": "The news story is clearly about the oil market, discussing crude oil prices, OPEC's production quotas, and Saudi Arabia's efforts to maintain price levels.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION. Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\" Guerard said.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the oil industry in California, specifically the drilling activity, oil production levels, and the impact of oil prices on these activities.

{"label": "crude", "text": "TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS. Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the oil industry and the proposed tax breaks to stimulate activity within that industry.

{"label": "crude", "text": "EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING. OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING. Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\" Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.", "rationale": "The news story is focused on the production and pricing strategies of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), specifically regarding crude oil output levels in relation to established production quotas and pricing agreements.

A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL. U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"crude.\" The story focuses on the rising prices of U.S. crude oil, the reduction in oil stocks, OPEC's production quotas, and the overall oil market dynamics.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.

The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN. The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,\" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.

{"label": "crude", "text": "OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING. OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. \"We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which centers around OPEC's commitment to fixed crude oil prices and overall output ceiling, the appropriate topic to assign to this news story from the provided set is \"crude.\"", "prediction": "crude"}

It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.

{"label": "crude", "text": "MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS. Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said. \"We don't intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability.\" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year.

The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. \"We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said.

Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.

{"label": "crude", "text": "SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR. Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.", "rationale": "This news story discusses the concerns and challenges faced by the private sector in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the context of an oil-dependent economy and the impact of fluctuating oil prices.

{"label": "crude", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY. Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, the primary focus is on Saudi Arabia's economic situation, particularly in relation to oil revenues and the balancing of its economy through austerity measures and the role of the private sector.

{"label": "crude", "text": "UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS. The \"cross field allowance\" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.", "rationale": "The news story is discussing a tax relief measure related to the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) in the UK, specifically in the context of oil field development.

Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.

But the French bank's plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in August 1982.

Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.

API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level. So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986. It said crude oil production for the first two months of 1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while crude imports were up 30.6 pct.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"crude.\" The story discusses U.S. crude oil production, domestic demand for petroleum products, and imports of petroleum.

Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield. \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today's agreement,\" adams said.

{"label": "crude", "text": "LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE. Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on tax relief measures for oil producers in the North Sea, the topic that should be assigned to this news story is \"crude.\" The story discusses the impact of tax changes on the economics of oil field development, oil-related research, and the offshore supplies industry, all of which are directly related to the crude oil sector.", "prediction": "crude"}

{"label": "crude", "text": "WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA. World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.

{"label": "crude", "text": "AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES. The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.

British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4.

Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field.

{"label": "crude", "text": "INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER. Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said.

The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. \"The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,\" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said.

The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.", "rationale": "The news story provided is about the Canadian federal government announcing an aid package for the oil industry.

{"label": "crude", "text": "AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY. Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels. \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around the Australian government's approach to crude oil tax strategy, including the possibility of a targeted tax and the ongoing review of oil taxation by the Federal Resources and Energy Minister.

{"label": "crude", "text": "CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS. Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is \"crude,\" as the article discusses the recovery of Canada's oil industry, which is directly related to crude oil prices, the performance of oil companies, and the impact of government aid on the industry.", "prediction": "crude"}

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS. Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it is time to go and sell coffee.\" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around the discussions of export quotas for coffee, the impact on coffee prices, and the failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to agree on these quotas, the topic to assign to this news story is \"coffee.\"", "prediction": "coffee"}
{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.. Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by \"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.", "rationale": "The news story focuses on the failure of talks regarding the re-establishment of International Coffee Organization (ICO) quotas, the United States' position on setting these quotas based on objective criteria, and the political and market implications of this situation.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC. Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. \"We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,\" Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. \"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,\" Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. \"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,\" he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although \"no hypothesis has been abandoned.\" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story should be \"coffee\" as the primary focus of the article is on Brazil's coffee exports, the breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, and the Brazilian Coffee Institute's (IBC) strategy in light of these events.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED. Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating. \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS. Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.

This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. \"The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,\" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. \"The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,\" he said. \"Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks,\" the roaster added.

Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, \"A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. \"We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO.\" Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, \"Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.\" Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,\" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.", "rationale": "The news story is primarily about the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export policy for coffee, as well as Brazil's position in the global coffee market following the failure of International Coffee Organization (ICO) talks.

Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE. Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy,\" he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume. \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,\" he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.\" Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. \"There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,\" he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved.

He said Brazil's current quota \"reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM. Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,\" he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,\" he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.\" Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\" He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. \"Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.\" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.", "rationale": "The news story discusses Colombia's approach to coffee marketing and export strategies in light of the challenges posed by the suspension of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas and current market conditions.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES. The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.", "rationale": "The topic that corresponds to the given news story is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the challenges and negotiations surrounding the restoration of coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Organization (ICO).

{"label": "coffee", "text": "NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER. New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story from the R52 dataset is \"coffee.\" The story discusses the trends and forecasts for coffee futures prices, market analysis by various analysts, and factors influencing the coffee market such as export quotas, producer stock levels, and demand.", "prediction": "coffee"}

{"label": "lumber", "text": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS. The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.

The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990. The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards. There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures. The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said. West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21. But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol. Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol. Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.", "rationale": "The topic of the news story is most closely related to \"environmental regulations\" within the context of the European Community's efforts to reduce air pollution from diesel exhaust emissions.

The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in January. The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.

Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, average work week and building permits. Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance, average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance, and contracts and orders for plant and equipment. The main factor in the January revision was contracts and orders for plant and equipment, the department said. December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier 2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.

{"label": "gas", "text": "ENERGY/U.S. REFINING. U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. \"If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said. \"The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,\" Martin said. \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation.\" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.", "rationale": "The news story discusses various concerns and challenges faced by U.S. refiners, including the impact of imports, environmental regulations, and the marketing of new gasoline grades.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT. A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year. France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December. At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.", "rationale": "The news story revolves around CRA Ltd, a mining and smelting group, discussing its financial outcomes, dividends, and performance across various minerals and operations.

{"label": "earn", "text": "TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>. General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value.\" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM,\" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important.\"", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which discusses General Motors Corp's share buyback program, stock performance, market share competition, and analysts' earnings estimates, the most relevant topic from the provided set would be:earn (earnings) The story focuses on financial aspects such as share value, dividends, and the company's strategies to enhance shareholder value, which all relate to GM's earnings and financial performance.", "prediction": "earn"}

Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln \"due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations,\" Guilbaud said.

Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989.

Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company.

RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY. &lt;British Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.

{"label": "earn", "text": "HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks,\" one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and Co>, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was much lower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. \"Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\" Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which focuses on the financial performance, profits, dividends, and business operations of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"earn\" (earnings).

Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.

A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar.

Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts. Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results. The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government's Inspector General of Banks. First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs. Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter. The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end. \"Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings prior to the announcement,\" Commerce bank said.

He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.

Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.

{"label": "cpi", "text": "U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION. Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year's pace, economists said. \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month. The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets. Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges. \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct. Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture. \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange.

Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.

Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986.

Rockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results, despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters. Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. \"It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share,\" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. \"I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts,\" Beall said, adding, \"long-term, we have a very serious problem.\" In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.", "rationale": "Based on the information provided in the news story, the topic that best fits is \"earn\" (earnings).

However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru in the same month.

Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS. Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "COFFEE FUTURES UNDER DLR A POUND AT SIX-YEAR LOW. Coffee futures dipped further and closed below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years. Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying. \"The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know which way to go,\" one analyst said. Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected.", "rationale": "The primary focus of this news story is on the coffee futures market, specifically mentioning the decline in coffee prices to a six-year low.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE. Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.", "rationale": "The topic that best fits the news story provided is \"coffee.\" The story centers around the issues faced by Indonesian coffee exporters, the negotiations over export quotas within the International Coffee Organization, and the positions of various countries on the quota system.", "prediction": "coffee"}

Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. \"The situation is unchanged,\" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. \"As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting.\" At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using \"objective criteria,\" which would likely have reduced Brazil's share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. \"As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags,\" he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said. The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification.

Madagascar's available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said. This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside, they said. The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985. Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said. They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes were planted before 1930. The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's 1986-1990 five-year plan. In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said. The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content. The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems.

Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies.

{"label": "coffee", "text": "IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale.", "rationale": "The news story is related to the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) and its export pricing system for coffee.

The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.

Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show. The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market. Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.", "rationale": "The news story discusses the French government's plans to combat long-term unemployment and stimulate the economy.

Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.

{"label": "earn", "text": "GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER. One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no one order will have much of an effect on the stock.\" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order \"will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.

Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise. For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct. Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation. Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said. Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices. Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986. Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase. Grocery store food prices were up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a third consecutive month, the department said. Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said. The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men's clothing, was responsible for the advance. Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said.", "rationale": "The topic for this news story is \"cpi\" (Consumer Price Index).", "prediction": "cpi"}

{"label": "earn", "text": "SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD. Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account.", "rationale": "Based on the content of the news story, which revolves around the performance of Saudi banks, their profits, provisions for non-performing loans, and overall banking sector challenges within the Saudi economy, the most appropriate topic to assign would be \"banking\" or \"financial services.\" However, since these exact options are not available in the set provided, the closest relevant topic from the list is \"reserves\" as the story discusses banks setting aside provisions to cover bad and doubtful debts, which is essentially a form of reserve.

The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and investment conglomerate &lt;Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns. \"These costs have arisen as a results of a change of direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have burdened the annual accounts,\" the company said in a statement. Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish companies. As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return to profitability during 1987, the statement added.

The topic \"strategic-metal\" is a broad term that can cover various metals that are considered to be of strategic importance for economic or technological reasons.
