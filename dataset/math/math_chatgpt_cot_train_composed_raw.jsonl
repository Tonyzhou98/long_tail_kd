The volume $V$ of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. The radius $r$ of the original cone is half of the diameter, so $r = 7$ cm, and the height $h$ is given as 24 cm. Thus, the volume of the original cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (7)^2 (24)$. To find the dimensions of the smaller cone, we set up a ratio because the cones are similar: $\\frac{7}{24} = \\frac{r'}{24-9}$, where $r'$ is the radius of the smaller cone. Solving for $r'$ gives us $r' = 3.5$ cm. The height $h'$ of the smaller cone is the total height minus the distance from the plane to the vertex, $h' = 24 - 9 = 15$ cm. Thus, the volume of the smaller cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (3.5)^2 (15)$. The volume of the frustum is the difference between the volumes of the two cones: $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (7)^2 (24) - \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (3.5)^2 (15)$. Calculating this, we get the volume of the frustum to be approximately $407.72$ cubic centimeters.The answer is: 407.72", "source": "Geometry"}

Given that $n$ is not a square, it must have an odd number of prime factors with some of them raised to an odd power. Since $n$ has $8$ divisors, its divisor function $\\tau(n)$ must equal $8$. The divisor function is the product of one more than the exponent of each prime factor in the prime factorization of $n$.

We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find this sum. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 999 is given by the formula $S = n(n+1)/2$, where $n=999$. Therefore, $S = 999(1000)/2 = 499500$. Now, we need to subtract the sums of the multiples of each prime factor. There are 499 multiples of 2 and their average is (2+998)/2 = 500, so their sum is 499 * 500. Similarly, there are 199 multiples of 5 with an average of (5+995)/2 = 500, and their sum is 199 * 500. There are 99 multiples of 10 to be subtracted, each with an average value of (10+990)/2 = 500; thus, the sum is 99 * 500.

A prime number larger than $2$ cannot be even, so if for some integer $x$, $x^2 + x + 41$ is even, then it can't be prime. $x^2 + x$ is always even since it's the sum of two consecutive integers (one of which must be even).

Substituting this into the equation, we get $2p = 11$, but since $p$ must be a whole number and a prime, our initial assumption that $q = 11$ is incorrect because $11$ cannot be expressed as two times a smaller prime. Thus, the next smallest prime is $13$, and substituting $q = 13$ into the equation we get $2p = 13$, which gives us $p = \\frac{13}{2}$, but since $p$ must be a prime, we correct this to say $p = 13/2$ is not a prime, hence we need to consider the next smallest prime which is $17$. Substituting $q = 17$ into the equation we get $2p = 17$, we have $p = \\frac{17}{2}$, which finally gives us $p = 17/2 = 8.5$, but since $p$ must be a prime number, we take the next smallest prime number which is $2$.

The first card drawn of this suit has a probability of 13/52. After drawing one card of the suit, there are now 12 cards of the same suit left, and 51 cards in total, so the probability the second card is of the same suit is 12/51. Similarly, the probability that the third card is also of the same suit is 11/50. To find the overall probability for one suit, we multiply these probabilities: (13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50). However, since there are 4 suits, we multiply this result by 4. This gives us 4 * (13/52) * (12/51) * (11/50) = (4 * 13 * 12 * 11) / (52 * 51 * 50). Simplifying the fraction, we get 11/850.

The probability of guessing 3 problems correctly is (1/4)^3, and the probability of guessing the other 2 incorrectly is (3/4)^2. Multiplying these together gives the probability for one specific set of 3 questions answered correctly. We must then multiply this probability by the number of ways to choose 3 correct questions out of 5 to get the final probability.

For scenario 1, there are 3 rolls, and each roll has a 1/6 chance of being a '4', and the remaining two rolls can be any number, so we get 3 * (1/6) * (1) * (1) = 1/2. For scenario 2, there are 3 different ways to choose which rolls will be the '2's, each '2' has a 1/6 chance, and the other roll can be 1, 3, or 5, which has a 1/2 chance, so we get 3 * (1/6)^2 * (1/2) = 1/24.

{"gt_choice": "255", "text": "Calculate the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 3, the common difference is 5, and the series has 10 terms.", "prediction": "255", "rationale": "To find the sum of an arithmetic series, we can use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term. The nth term of an arithmetic series can be found with the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference. With $a_1 = 3$, $d = 5$, and $n = 10$, we calculate the 10th term: $a_{10} = 3 + (10 - 1) \\cdot 5 = 3 + 9 \\cdot 5 = 3 + 45 = 48$. Now, we can find the sum: $S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2}(3 + 48) = 5 \\cdot 51 = 255$. Thus, the answer is: 255", "source": "Precalculus"}
