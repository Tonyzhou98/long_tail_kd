The addition of the walking path increases the overall area to 2,000 square feet, implying an increase of 2,000 - 1,200 = 800 square feet. Assume the width of the walking path is 'w' feet. The new dimensions of the garden including the path are (30 + 2w) by (40 + 2w) feet, because the path is added uniformly around the garden. The equation for the new area is thus (30 + 2w)(40 + 2w) = 2,000. Expanding this gives 1,200 + 60w + 80w + 4w^2 = 2,000.

This follows from the Pythagorean theorem as well, since for a right triangle with equal legs $a$ and $a$, $a^2 + a^2 = h^2$ where $h$ is the hypotenuse, so $2a^2 = 10^2$ or $a^2 = 50$, and thus $a = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.

The length of AM (and similarly MB) is half the length of the chord, which is 12/2 = 6 units. Now, to find the area of the segment, subtract the area of triangle OAB from the area of the sector OAMB. Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle OAM gives AM = 6 units and OM = 6 units, you can find the length of OA as the hypotenuse, but since OA is a radius, we know it's 8 units, confirming the consistency of our triangle. The area of triangle OAB can be calculated as base times height divided by 2, which is (12*6)/2 = 36 square units. The central angle \u03b8 corresponding to the arc AMB can be found using cosine rule in triangle OAM where cos(\u03b8/2) = 6/8 = 0.75, so \u03b8/2 = arccos(0.75) and therefore \u03b8 is 2*arccos(0.75).

Now, for the smaller square inscribed within the circle, its corners touch the midpoint of the circle's circumference.

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with semiperimeter (s) and sides a, b, and c is A = \u221a(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s = (a+b+c)/2. For our right triangle, s = (8+15+17)/2 = 20 cm.

According to this theorem, the length of the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the lengths of the segments into which it divides the hypotenuse. In other words, if $PT$ and $PR$ are the segments of the hypotenuse divided by point $P$, then $SP^2 = PT \\cdot PR$. Since $RST$ is a right triangle with legs 5 and 12 units, by the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse $RT$ is $\\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13$ units. The altitude $\\overline{SP}$ divides the hypotenuse into two segments, let's call them $PT$ and $PR$, which sum up to the length of the hypotenuse, so $PT + PR = 13$.   Using similarity, we know that the two triangles $RSP$ and $PST$ are similar to the original triangle $RST$, because they all share one angle from the original triangle, and they all have a right angle (by the altitude being perpendicular to the hypotenuse). This means the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Thus, if we let $PT = x$ units, then $PR = 13 - x$ units, and using the geometric mean theorem mentioned earlier, $SP^2 = x(13 - x)$. Using the fact that $RS = 5$ units and the similarity of triangles $RSP$ and $RST$, the ratio $RS/RT = SP/ST$ must hold. Therefore, $5/13 = SP/12$. Solving for $SP$ gives $SP = 60/13$ units. Squaring this length and equating it to the earlier expression $x(13 - x)$, we find $SP^2 = (60/13)^2 = x(13 - x)$. Solving this equation (usually requiring algebraic manipulation), we find that the value of $x$ that satisfies this is not needed because we are interested in the length of $SP$, which we already have as $60/13$ units.

Adding 64 and 225 gives us 289, which is equal to 17^2. This confirms that the triangle is a right triangle. The area of a right triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Here, the base and height can be considered as the two sides that are not the hypotenuse, so the area is (1/2) * 8 cm * 15 cm = 4 cm * 15 cm = 60 cm^2. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 60 square centimeters. The answer is: 60", "source": "Geometry"}

Now, applying the second condition to these candidates, the integer must also be one less than a square number. The smallest square numbers are 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, and 4^2=16. We look for a match where our candidate integer is also 4 less than one of these squares. The first candidate that fits this is 8, because 12 (the next square number after 9) minus 4 is 8. However, 8 is not 3 more than a prime, so we discard it. The next integer to test would be 9+3=12, which isn't 1 less than a square. We continue with 11+3=14, which also isn't 1 less than a square.

We start by checking the first few powers of $2$ modulo $1000$ until we notice a pattern or reach the desired ending. Note that this process can be lengthy, and there might not be an immediately obvious pattern. However, we can simplify the process by breaking down $1000$ into prime factors, which are $2^3$ and $5^3$.

The previous assumption that the 4th term must be 8 assumes a process of repeatedly applying the rule until the number no longer changes, leading to terms like 153 and 371. However, the description of the sequence does not specify this iterative process; it only refers to summing the cubes of the digits once.

The ratio between the terms must also be a power of $a$, thus $k = a^c$ for some $c > 0$. We have $q = p \\cdot a^c$ and $r = q \\cdot a^c = p \\cdot a^{2c}$. The sum is $p + q + r = p + p \\cdot a^c + p \\cdot a^{2c} = p(1 + a^c + a^{2c}) < 100$. Since $p$ is a power of a prime and must be multiplied by two larger powers, it must be the smallest possible non-trivial power of the prime, which is the prime itself. The smallest non-trivial prime is $2$, so we test with $p = 2^1 = 2$. This gives us $2(1 + 2^c + 2^{2c}) < 100$. The largest $c$ that satisfies this for $p=2$ is $c=2$, leading to $2(1 + 2^2 + 2^4) = 2(1 + 4 + 16) = 2(21) = 42$, which is less than 100. This makes $q = p \\cdot a^c = 2 \\cdot 2^2 = 2^3 = 8$.

For $c=1$, this gives $3(1 + 3 + 9) = 3(13) = 39$, and the next value for $c$, which is $2$, exceeds 100. Therefore, with $p = 3^1 = 3$ and $c=1$, we have $q = 3 \\cdot 3^1 = 3^2 = 9$. This exceeds the previous maximum for $q$, so we continue with larger primes.  Testing with the next prime, $5$, and using $c=1$ (since a larger $c$ will clearly exceed 100), we get $5(1 + 5 + 25) = 5(31) = 155$, which exceeds 100 and is thus not valid. Hence, the prime number we are looking for must be $3$, and the maximum value of $q$ when $p$ is a power of $3$ is $q = 3^2 = 9$. However, we are looking for the largest possible $q$ that is a power of the same prime and is less than 100 when $p$ and $r$ are also powers of the same prime number. The next power of $3$ that we can test for $q$ is $3^3 = 27$. As $p$ must be smaller and $27$ is already a cube, the only way to maintain a geometric progression with powers of $3$ is to let $p = 3^2 = 9$ and $r = 3^4 = 81$. This gives us $9 + 27 + 81 = 117$, which exceeds 100. Therefore, $q$ cannot be $27$ since it would make the sum too large. The largest possible value of $q$ with a sum less than 100 is, therefore, $q = 3^2 = 9$. However, this isn't the final answer because, as initially established, $q = p \\cdot a^c$, and we must ensure we are using the smallest power for $p$ (which is the prime itself) to maximize $q$ and meet the criterion that the sum is less than 100. We already found that for $p=2$ and $c=2$ the sum allows for the largest $q < 100$. Thus, the correct largest possible value for $q$ is when it is a power of $2$: $q = 2^c = 2^5 = 32$, which provides a sum of $2 + 32 + 2^7 = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 < 100$.

The next smallest palindrome that could feasibly be a multiple of a prime $p > 3$ is 101 because 22, 33, 44, etc., are all even and thus not prime. Since 101 is also a prime number, it will not be divisible by any other prime $p$. The next smallest palindrome after 101 is 111, which is 3 multiplied by 37.

So, for any $p$ that is not 11 or 37 (since they lead to palindromes 11 and 111, respectively), we must consider larger palindromes. However, the key insight is that as we move to larger palindromes, they will be divisible by primes other than themselves, or they will be composite. The next smallest palindromes, 121, 131, 141, and so on, are not prime and not divisible by prime numbers greater than 3, except for themselves if they happen to be prime (like 131).

The smallest primes are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...$ and so on. Since $1729$ is an odd number, it cannot be divisible by $2$. If we sum the digits of $1729$ ($1+7+2+9=19$), we see that this sum is not a multiple of $3$; hence, $1729$ is not divisible by $3$. Next, $1729$ does not end in $0$ or $5$, which means it is not divisible by $5$. However, when we divide $1729$ by $7$, we get $247$ with no remainder, so $7$ is a factor and we exclude it. $1729$ is not divisible by $11$ since, for a number to be divisible by $11$, the alternating sum of its digits must be a multiple of $11$, and $1-7+2-9=-13$ is not. For $13$, $1729$ mod $13$ yields $3$, indicating $13$ is not a divisor. Without performing the division, we can see that the primes $17$ and $19$ are too large to be factors of $1729$ without having already encountered a smaller factor that is a multiple.

An integer is relatively prime to 50 if it does not share any prime factors with 50, meaning it is not divisible by 2 or 5. Among the first 50 positive integers, the numbers that are not relatively prime to 50 are the multiples of 2 and 5. Since 50 is 2 times 25 and 5 times 10, there are 25 multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6, ..., 50) and 10 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, ..., 50). However, every second multiple of 5 (10, 20, 30, ..., 50) is also a multiple of 2, which we've already counted. Thus, we only need to subtract the 10 multiples of 5 once from the total sum. The sum of the first 50 positive integers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, S = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms, which gives us S = 50/2 * (1 + 50) = 25 * 51 = 1275. To find the sum of the numbers relatively prime to 50, we subtract the sum of the multiples of 2 and 5 from 1275. As every multiple of 2 can be expressed as 2k where k = 1 to 25, their sum is 2 * (1+2+...+25) = 2 * 25/2 * (1+25) = 650. And, since the multiples of 5 can be expressed as 5k where k = 1 to 10, their sum is 5 * (1+2+...+10) = 5 * 10/2 * (1+10) = 275. Subtracting both sums from 1275, we get 1275 - 650 - 275 = 350.

The sum of the multiples of 10 up to 50 is 10 * (1+2+...+5) = 10 * 5/2 * (1+5) = 150. Adding this back to 350 we get 350 + 150 = 500. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers up to 50 that are relatively prime to 50 is 500, not 100, since we have accounted for all the necessary additions and subtractions to exclude the multiples of 50's prime factors.

This implies that $2^5 - 1$ or $2^5 + 1$ must be divisible by $11$ since $11$ is prime and must divide one of the factors. Since $2^5 \\equiv -1 \\mod 11$, it follows that $2^5 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 11$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $2^k - 1$ is divisible by $11$ is $k=5+1=6$.

We find that 34 is the smallest number that works because $34 = 5 \\times 6 + 4$ satisfies the first condition, and $34 = 7 \\times 4 + 6$ satisfies the second condition. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions is 34. The answer is: 34", "source": "Number Theory"}

Thus, a number that is both a perfect square and cube must have an exponent that is a multiple of both, which is 6. The smallest such positive integer greater than $10^2$ (since its square root must be greater than 10) is $2^6 = 64$. However, 64 is not greater than $10^2$.

The constant term $99$ suggests that the perfect square closest to it is $10^2 = 100$. For the quadratic to be a perfect square, the expression can be written as $(x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2$, where $a$ is an integer. We notice that the coefficient of $x$ in the original expression is $-19$, which must correspond to $-2a$ in the perfect square form, hence $a = \\frac{19}{2}$. Since $a$ must be an integer, we look for the closest integers to $\\frac{19}{2}$, which are $9$ and $10$. Trying $a = 9$ leads us to $(x - 9)^2 = x^2 - 18x + 81$. To get the constant term to match $99$, we add $18$ to $81$ resulting in $99$, which gives us the original constant term. Thus, the perfect square that the expression can be factored into is $(x - 9)^2$, and $x$ must be $9$ to make the expression a perfect square. However, $9$ is not the smallest positive integer solution since the problem asks for the smallest positive integer $x$ such that the full expression is a perfect square, not just the constant term.   We next try $a = 10$, which gives us $(x - 10)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 100$. We need to adjust this to match our original expression. By adding $1$ to both sides we get $(x - 10)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 20x + 101$. We then need to subtract $2x$ from each side to match the coefficient of $x$ in the original expression: $(x - 10)^2 + 1 - 2x = x^2 - 20x + 101 - 2x = x^2 - 22x + 101$. Finally, by subtracting $2$ from both sides, we obtain $(x - 10)^2 - 1 = x^2 - 22x + 99$, which closely resembles our expression except the coefficient of $x$ is $-22$ instead of $-19$.   To fix this, we observe that $(x - 11)^2 = x^2 - 22x + 121$. By subtracting $22$ from both sides we get $(x - 11)^2 - 22 = x^2 - 22x + 99$, which matches our original expression, meaning that $x^2 - 19x + 99$ is indeed a perfect square when $x = 11$. This solution relies on the insight that $(x - 11)^2$ provides the necessary structure for the expression to become a perfect square and also satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ that makes $x^2 - 19x + 99$ a perfect square is $x = 11$. The answer is: 11", "source": "Number Theory"}

Lastly, for $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, $x$ must be 1 less than a multiple of 6.   We first notice that the conditions $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ both require $x$ to be odd, as even numbers cannot leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. Moreover, a number 1 less than a multiple of 6 (6n - 1) will always be odd and satisfy $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ since 6n is always even, making 6n - 1 leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.  Therefore, we only need to manually check numbers of the form 6n - 1 that also satisfy $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$; the lowest common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12, and multiples of 12 minus 1 are candidates. Checking the first few, we find that 11 does not work since it is not 2 modulo 5, 23 does not work either, but when we check 35 (which is 12*3-1), we find that $35 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$.  However, the question asks for the smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies the conditions, and 35 does not leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. We notice that our expression 12n - 1 will only work if n is a multiple of 5 to meet the second condition (since the original LCM of 4 and 5 is 20, and our pattern repeats every 20, not 12). Thus, we must find a multiple of 5 that, when multiplied by 12 and reduced by 1, leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. The first such number is 5*3 = 15; when we calculate 12*15 - 1, we get 179, which is not 2 modulo 5. Continuing this pattern, the next number to check is 20 (5*4), giving us 239, which again does not work. The next is 25 (5*5), yielding 12*25 - 1 = 299, which once again does not work. Finally, we try 30 (5*6) giving us 12*30 - 1 = 359, which does not work, but 35 (5*7) gives us 12*35 - 1 = 419, which also doesn't work. Continuing this process, we finally arrive at 5*21 = 105, and 12*105 - 1 = 1259, which is congruent to 2 modulo 5 and 1 modulo 6.   However, we've overlooked a simpler approach. Rather than incrementing by 12, we should directly find multiples of 5 that satisfy the other two congruences. We are looking for a number of the form 5n that satisfies $5n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Testing multiples of 5, we find that for n=1, $5*1$ does not work; for n=2, $5*2$ does not work; but for n=3, $5*3 = 15$ works perfectly for the modulo 4 condition. However, it does not satisfy the modulo 6 condition. Continuing this, we find that $5*21 = 105$ does work, as $105 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, $105 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, and by construction, $105 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $x$ satisfying all three congruences is $x = 105$. The answer is: 105", "source": "Number Theory"}

This algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until you reach a remainder of 0, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero remainder. However, for large numbers, it's more efficient to use division rather than subtraction. First, divide 123456 by 7890: this gives a quotient of 15 and a remainder of 5766. Then divide 7890 by this remainder (5766), giving a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2124. Continue this process: divide 5766 by 2124 to get a remainder of 1518, and then divide 2124 by 1518 to get a remainder of 606. Finally, divide 1518 by 606 to find that it goes exactly 2.5 times, indicating that 606 is the remainder. Since 606 is a multiple of 6, and both 1518 and 2124 were divisible by 606, 606 divides both 123456 and 7890, so we test the divisibility of 606 by smaller numbers. Upon checking, we find that 606 is divisible by 6 (since 6 + 0 + 6 = 12, which is divisible by 6), which means that 6 is a common divisor of 123456 and 7890. To confirm that 6 is the greatest common divisor, we divide both original numbers by 6 and ensure that the results are coprime (have no common divisors other than 1). We have 123456 \u00f7 6 = 20576 and 7890 \u00f7 6 = 1315. Since 20576 ends in a 6 and 1315 ends in a 5, they are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. A quick check for divisibility by 7, 11, and 13 (or any other small prime numbers up to the square root of 1315) shows no common divisors, confirming that these two numbers are coprime.

Since $(k-1)$ and $(k+1)$ are two consecutive even integers, one of them must be a multiple of 2, and the other must be a multiple of 10, or vice versa. The smallest such pair is (14,16), because 14 is a multiple of 2 and not of 10, and 16 is a multiple neither of 2 nor 10; hence we skip to the next pair (24,26), where 24 is a multiple of 6 but not of 10, and 26 is a multiple neither of 2 nor 10. The next pair is (34,36), and 36 is a multiple of 6. Since 34 is not a multiple of 10, we continue.

The probability of drawing a marble of any color first is certain, as we are not yet concerned with its color (10/10 = 1).  2. For the second draw, we want a marble that is not the same color as the first. If the first marble was red, there are now 9 marbles left, with 3 blue and 2 green, so the probability of drawing a different color is (3+2)/9. The same logic applies if the first marble was blue or green; the probability for drawing a different color second is always 5/9 since there would be 5 marbles of the other two colors combined out of the remaining 9.  3. For the third draw, we want a marble of the remaining color. Assuming the first two marbles were of different colors, there are 8 marbles left, with 2 of one color (the color not yet drawn) and the rest in the other colors. Therefore, the probability of drawing a marble of the third color is 2/8 (or 1/4).  Combining these probabilities using the rule of product for independent events (because each draw affects the outcome of the subsequent draw), we get: 1 * (5/9) * (1/4) = 5/36. However, since there are 3 different colors, we must consider that the first marble could be any of the three colors, so there are 3 different successful scenarios (R-B-G, B-G-R, or G-R-B), and thus the final probability is 3 times the single scenario probability: 3 * (5/36) = 15/36, which simplifies to 5/12. This is the probability that all three marbles pulled out one after another without replacement are of different colors. The answer is: \\frac{5}{12}", "source": "Counting & Probability"}

For the first marble, there's no restriction, so we have a total of 12 choices. Let's say we pick a red marble first; there are 4 reds out of the 12 marbles. Now, with 11 marbles remaining, there are 5 blue ones, so the probability of picking a blue next is 5/11. After picking a red and a blue, there are 10 marbles left, including 3 green marbles. The probability of now picking a green marble is 3/10. To find the overall probability for this sequence (red, then blue, then green), we multiply the probabilities: (4/12) * (5/11) * (3/10) = (1/3) * (5/11) * (3/10) = 15/330 = 1/22. However, since the marbles could be picked in any color order, we must consider all permutations of the sequence (red, blue, green), which is 3! (3 factorial) or 6 different ways.

The probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/15 (since there are 4 red marbles out of 15 total). After drawing a red marble, there are 14 marbles left, and the probability of drawing a blue one is now 5/14.

Similarly, the probability for two blue marbles is (4/12) * (4/12), and for two green marbles is (3/12) * (3/12). Adding these probabilities gives (5/12)^2 + (4/12)^2 + (3/12)^2 = (25/144) + (16/144) + (9/144) = (25 + 16 + 9) / 144 = 50/144 + 9/144 = 59/144.

The total number of ways to draw three balls out of 12 (4 red, 5 blue, and 3 green) is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of balls and k is the number of balls drawn. Therefore, C(12, 3) = 12! / [3!(12-3)!] = 220. This is the denominator of our probability fraction.  For the numerator, we want two red balls and one non-red (blue or green) ball. There are C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 red balls from 4, which is 6. There are C(8, 1) ways to choose 1 ball from the remaining 8 non-red balls, which is 8. So the number of favorable outcomes is 6 (ways to choose red balls) times 8 (ways to choose a non-red ball), resulting in 48 ways to obtain exactly two red balls.  Hence, the probability of drawing exactly two red balls is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: P = 48 / 220. Simplifying this fraction, we get P = 12 / 55.

What is the probability that the product of the three numbers rolled is a multiple of 4?", "prediction": "\\frac{13}{24}", "rationale": "To determine the probability that the product of three numbers rolled on a standard six-sided die is a multiple of 4, we need to consider the ways in which we can obtain such a product. For a product to be a multiple of 4, at least two factors of 2 must be present in the prime factorization. In the context of the die rolls, this means that at least two of the three rolls must result in a number that contains the factor 2, which are 2, 4, and 6. Rolling a 4 actually provides us with two factors of 2, which is sufficient by itself to ensure that the product is a multiple of 4, regardless of the other rolls.  We have three scenarios for the rolls: 1. At least one roll is a 4: With 3 chances to roll a 4, the probability of not rolling any 4's in one roll is 5/6. So, the probability of not rolling a 4 in three rolls is (5/6)^3, and the probability of rolling at least one 4 is 1 - (5/6)^3. 2. Two rolls are even (2, 4, or 6), but not case 1: Each die has a 1/2 chance of being even, so the probability of exactly two evens in three rolls is 3 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2) (for three combinations of which two could be even). 3. All three rolls are even, but not case 1: The probability of all three being even is (1/2)^3.  Adding these probabilities gives us the total probability for the product to be a multiple of 4: 1 - (5/6)^3 + 3 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2) + (1/2)^3. Simplifying this expression yields the final probability of 13/24 that the product of the three rolls is a multiple of 4.

For red marbles: Similarly, out of 7 red marbles, choosing 3 without replacement has a probability of \\(\\frac{{7 \\choose 3}}{{20 \\choose 3}}\\).

The number of ways to draw one of each color is therefore the product of these, which is 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 30.  Next, we determine the total number of ways to draw any three marbles.

Now, we need to consider the total number of ways to pick any two marbles from the bag.

This can be done in C(11,2) ways (combinations of 11 students taken 2 at a time). The same logic applies for the second scenario with Bob, yielding another C(11,2) possibilities. Since C(11,2) = 11! / (2! * (11-2)!) = 11! / (2! * 9!) = (11 * 10) / (2 * 1) = 55, we have 55 options for each scenario. Adding both scenarios together, 55 + 55, we get 110 possible groups.

This involves finding the number of combinations of two green marbles from the six available, C(6, 2), and multiplying by the number of combinations of drawing one marble that is not green from the nine that are not green (4 red and 5 blue), C(9, 1). The probability is the product of these combinations divided by the total possible combinations: (C(6, 2) * C(9, 1)) / C(15, 3).

There are two scenarios to consider for this to happen: RR(B) or R(B)R or (B)RR, where R represents a red marble and B represents a blue marble, and each set of parentheses indicates the third draw.  First, we calculate the probability of the first scenario (RRB): The probability of drawing a red marble first is 7/12, since there are 7 red marbles and a total of 12 marbles. Once a red marble is drawn, there are 6 red marbles left and 11 marbles in total, so the probability of drawing a second red marble is 6/11. Finally, with two red marbles removed, there are 5 blue marbles and 10 marbles in total, making the probability of drawing a blue marble 5/10 or 1/2. Thus, the probability of RRB is (7/12) * (6/11) * (1/2).  Next, we recognize that the probability for each of the three scenarios (RRB, RBR, BRR) is the same due to the symmetry of the problem. Since there are three such distinct scenarios, we multiply the probability we calculated for one scenario by 3 to get the final answer.  Therefore, the probability of drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble in any order is 3 * (7/12) * (6/11) * (1/2) = (21/44), as each of the 3 terms in the product corresponds to the probability of a particular scenario and the number 3 accounts for each possible arrangement of drawing 2 red and 1 blue marble.

The Z-score is given by the formula Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. For a score of 75, the Z-score is Z = (75 - 80) / 5 = -1. For a score of 85, the Z-score is Z = (85 - 80) / 5 = 1. Next, we consult the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores. The table or calculator gives the probability that a value is less than a given Z-score. The probability of a Z-score being less than 1 is approximately 0.8413, and the probability of a Z-score being less than -1 is 0.1587. To find the probability of a score falling between 75 and 85, we subtract the probability of being below the lower Z-score from the probability of being below the higher Z-score: 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826. Thus, there is approximately a 68.26% chance that a randomly selected score from the class will be between 75 and 85.

The derivative of $g(u)$ with respect to $u$ is simply $g'(u) = 2$ as it is a linear function, and the derivative of $h(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $h'(x) = 3e^{3x}$ because the derivative of $e^kx$ with respect to $x$ is $ke^kx$ where $k$ is a constant.

However, we do not need to find the specific values of $c$ and $d$, because they will not affect the calculation of $f'(2)$.

Substituting $k = 12 - a$ into this equation, we get $c = 9a + 12 - a = 8a + 12$. Now we require a second point that we know lies on the parabola. The symmetry and the given point $(2, 12)$ help us here: since $2$ is one unit away from the axis of symmetry at $x = 3$, there must also be a corresponding point one unit on the other side of the axis at $x = 4$. This point will have the same $y$-value as the point $(2, 12)$, so the point $(4, 12)$ also lies on the parabola. Plugging $x = 4$ and $y = 12$ into the standard form, we get $12 = a(4)^2 + 4b + c$ which simplifies to $12 = 16a + 4b + c$. We already have $c = 8a + 12$ from the vertex form; substituting this into the previous equation gives us $12 = 16a + 4b + (8a + 12)$, which simplifies to $0 = 24a + 4b$. This equation indicates a linear relationship between $a$ and $b$, but without additional information, we cannot determine unique values for $a$ and $b$. However, we don't need to find $a$ or $b$ to determine $c$ because we can use the axis of symmetry and the given points on the parabola. Since the vertex form relates directly to the axis of symmetry and the vertex, and $c$ is the $y$-value when $x = 0$, we use symmetry to find that $c = 20$. Specifically, the symmetry about $x = 3$ means we also have the point $(4, 12)$ on the parabola by symmetry, giving us $12 = a(4 - 3)^2 + k = a + k$. Since $12 = a(1) + k$ and $12 = a + k$ must both be true, and $a > 0$, we can deduce that $a = 0$ and $k = 12$. This makes the vertex $(3, 12)$ and since $c$ is simply the $y$ value when $x = 0$, we have $c = k + a(-3)^2 = 12 + 0(9) = 20$. The answer is: 20", "source": "Precalculus"}

Given that the maximum of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = \\pi n$, we can deduce that $n$ must be even for the cosine function to align with its maximum at these points, since cosine is periodic with period $2\\pi$.  To find the smallest positive value of $k$ such that $f(x+k)$ has a maximum at $x = 0$, we need to shift the function to the left by the smallest positive amount so that the current maximum at $x = \\pi n$ (with $n$ being even) aligns with $x = 0$. This shift would be equivalent to the distance from $\\pi n$ (the current maximum) to $0$ along the x-axis. Since we want the smallest positive shift and $n$ can be any integer, we choose $n = 0$, which would make the shift $\\pi (0) = 0$.

This provides us with a positive $k$ equal to the distance from $\\pi \\cdot 2 = 2\\pi$ (the current maximum) to $0$. The distance is simply $2\\pi$, thus the smallest positive $k$ is $2\\pi$.
